Bbbbb, you think, you aren't going to worry about every single conversational detail, THIS TIME.
Guy Sweet blinks at you. "Whoah! You're, like, more accelerated than most people at this whole social thing. Here, play a game, any game. It's sort of an aptitude test thing."
!err, abridged

Guy Sweet blinks at you. "Whoah! You're, like, more accelerated than most people at this whole social thing. Here, play a game, any game. It's sort of an aptitude test thing."
Well. Now that you, err, abridged the conversation, you feel as though you can abridge how you think of it. Instead of BROOK BABBLING, well, BB (with or without a space) would work.

>talk
You've already had a chat. Re-summarize?
You forget the details, but it went a little something like this:

Guy seemed impressed you took initiative and weren't intimidated, but he's still waiting for you to play a game.

You mumble something about not really having anything to say, and sorry, and sorry for wasting time with an unnecessary apology.

"Whatever, dude." It's--a bit harsh, you're not sure what you did to deserve that, but probably something.

You're wearing a face of loss, and there's that thought of school kicking around, too.

You imagine the Word Weasel saying that anything you do for it would be doing for you, because it probably knows what's good for you.
Dang it. It's not the first time you thought of a clever response but balked at the last second.

>talk to wall
Mostly, you'll want to talk to people or animals, and in some cases a machine capable of receiving input.

>x earth
It's opaque, probably earth of salt or something, and it seems half-buried. You think if you look closely you see something under it that's not dirt or salt. But you can't just move it away by conventional means.

>dig
With your pocket pick, the work is steady and clean, if arduous. Your cheap pocket pick starts splitting off--why couldn't the earth of salt been earth of scum or something easier to hack at?--and it snaps in two with the final blow.

Beneath is a thin plaque. But not just any plaque: a PROOF OF BURDEN. You wipe it off and pick it up, then you bury the pocket pick, which is not only broken but also rusted.

The usual greetings, as he exhorts you to be good--not too good, though. Maybe if you have some proof you're not totally boring and squeaky clean, you'll be bare-knuckle enough for the Compound proper. You'll--well, you'll know what, once you start picking up demerits.
