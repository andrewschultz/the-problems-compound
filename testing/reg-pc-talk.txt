Bbbbb, you think, you aren't going to worry about every single conversational detail, THIS TIME.
Guy Sweet blinks at you. "Whoah! You're, like, more accelerated than most people at this whole social thing. Here, play a game, any game. It's sort of an aptitude test thing."
!err, abridged

Guy Sweet blinks at you. "Whoah! You're, like, more accelerated than most people at this whole social thing. Here, play a game, any game. It's sort of an aptitude test thing."
Well. Now that you, err, abridged the conversation, you feel as though you can abridge how you think of it. Instead of BROOK BABBLING, well, BB (with or without a space) would work.

>talk
You've already had a chat. Re-summarize?
You forget the details, but it went a little something like this:

Guy seemed impressed you took initiative and weren't intimidated, but he's still waiting for you to play a game.

>talk

You mumble something about not really having anything to say, and sorry, and sorry for wasting time with an unnecessary apology.

"Whatever, dude." It's--a bit harsh, you're not sure what you did to deserve that, but probably something.

[1] How'd you get stuck here?
[2] Any advice on any of the games?
[3] So. What's in the flat?
[4] Um, later.

You can't escape the conversation running nowhere! Well, you can't really escape it running anywhere, either. You're not good at slick exits. (NOTE: to see dialog options, type RECAP)

>y
You don't need to say yes or no unless you're directly asked a yes/no question.

>sleep
That'd be a bit insulting. People have yawned around you before, but...you can't do it back to them.

>notice advance
Whoah! You could totally do that. But not while you're talking. You'll need to say goodbye to Guy first.

>duck sitting

>listen
Well, you just did, and now it's your turn to respond.

>smell
Others can throw you off with a well-timed sniff, but not vice versa.

>talk to me
That might bug Guy Sweet.

>talk to guy
You're already in a conversation with Guy Sweet.

>attack guy
You've been baited into fights before, but there's been nothing TOO bad here.

>i
You're not carrying anything.
You're wearing a face of loss, and there's that thought of school kicking around, too.

>score
You don't need to worry about score yet. You've just got here.

>think
You get distracted, but you've never had the power to break a conversation off. (NOTE: to see dialog options, type RECAP)

"Whatever, dude."

>talk to guy
You don't have anything left to say except hello, good-bye. But here's a summary: Guy talked about the Baiter Master and how you'd have to be very clever to meet him, and when you did, you'd better not waste his time.

Something about how it's willing to give you his signature, which is very valuable indeed helping you move on in the world. It seems interested in a swap.

"Here to weed out people who don't belong. Ah, good, you didn't laugh at the weed/garden pun. There's hope for you yet! But I just have so much to say--you will listen to it all before asking anything of me, won't you?"

>1
You imagine the Word Weasel saying that anything you do for it would be doing for you, because it probably knows what's good for you.
Dang it. It's not the first time you thought of a clever response but balked at the last second.

"This isn't nap dirt, here. It won't DIG itself while you're gone."

>dig
"Ah, the art of work!" the Weasel says as you begin. It throws on a few more aphorisms about exercise and experience and advice that, well, motivate you not to take breaks. "You've paid off your debt now."

The mouth mush harangues you about needing certification to go through the arch to the north. This isn't a big area, so it can't be far.

You forget the details, but it went a little something like this:

The mouth mush wanted some sort of document.

>talk to wall
Mostly, you'll want to talk to people or animals, and in some cases a machine capable of receiving input.

>x earth
It's opaque, probably earth of salt or something, and it seems half-buried. You think if you look closely you see something under it that's not dirt or salt. But you can't just move it away by conventional means.

>dig
With your pocket pick, the work is steady and clean, if arduous. Your cheap pocket pick starts splitting off--why couldn't the earth of salt been earth of scum or something easier to hack at?--and it snaps in two with the final blow.

Beneath is a thin plaque. But not just any plaque: a PROOF OF BURDEN. You wipe it off and pick it up, then you bury the pocket pick, which is not only broken but also rusted.

>i
probably read

>x proof
It is blank.

>i
unsigned

>talk to me
You've already taken heat for talking to yourself, especially from people who give themselves pep talks before the big game. But with people around or no, it's a bad habit. Socially, at least.

"I could, but you'd have to GIVE it to me first." It smirks.

It doesn't seem to want to talk any more, and come to think of it, neither do you, really. It's time to get a move on.

>e
>talk to mush
You don't have much to say, now you have the signed burden. Maybe just GIVE it to the mouth.

>knock hard

>bb
The usual greetings, as he exhorts you to be good--not too good, though. Maybe if you have some proof you're not totally boring and squeaky clean, you'll be bare-knuckle enough for the Compound proper. You'll--well, you'll know what, once you start picking up demerits.

You'd like to say that, and someone with more courage can, but you can't right now.

As you turn away, Fritz mumbles something about hoping you find genuine consciousness. You seem closer than most squares here.

The usual ordering to keep your nose clean, don't go off the beaten path, or litter, or annoy people, or have illicit substances.

That might bug the Stool Toad.

You're already in a conversation with the Stool Toad.

He might be insulted if you give it back.

Erin ignores your offer. Perhaps if you talked to her first, she might be more receptive.
