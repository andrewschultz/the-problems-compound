>jump

You can make the following jumps:
--DUCK SITTING to skip to Tension Surface.
--KNOCK HARD to get to Pressure Pier.
--FIGURE A CUT to skip past Terry Sally to the Nominal Fen.
--FANCY PASSING to skip to the Questions Field with the brothers gone.
--TRACK BEATEN to reveal the Nominal Fen puzzle spoilers on examining the Finger Index.
--NOTICE ADVANCE to skip to Questions Field, with the brothers and Nominal Fen solved.

>anno
This is the command for annotations, which are usually only for after you win the game. While it has no spoilers, and it can be toggled, it may be a distraction. Are you sure you want to activate annotations?
!Okay. You can undo if you change your mind.
Now annotations are on, and, in fact, there's one to check right here (1). You may also wish to JUMP to the director's cut area for a lot of notes.

!You don't seem to have unlocked that verb yet. Are you sure you wish to go ahead?

Now annotations are on. You may still wish to JUMP to the director's cut area for a lot of notes.

>note
You should be able to NOTE (location) for any location you visited with annotations on. In addition, you should be able to NOTE (item) or NOTE (number) for the number of an item.
There is only one note so far.

One Route

(ROOM ANNO) It was either this or One Square or Way One, at the beginning. But those two got carded off to something better: Meal Square and, well, Way of Right should be in Slicker City.

>think
NOTE: THINK will redirect to SCORE in the future, unless you really only have one specific task remaining.
You take a thought-second. Then you take another, but you reflect it wasn't as good. OR WAS IT? So you just think about what you've accomplished...

You have eleven rejected rooms to visit here (JUMP back once you're finished,) and you haven't found the place that lets you see the hidden ones and the fake-bad-end scenes.

Oh no, this extra material isn't THAT boring, is it?

Nothing they say is funny. It's all inside jokes, or stuff about celebrities, or overgeneralization. You wish they could be dealt with (this is one of my very favorite bad puns. You're welcome.)

With the pressure off, you don't feel violent.

You have neither matches nor pyromaniac desires.

You don't want to hear his views on religion. They generally involve telling poor people to shut up and be happy and fake-smiling at anyone who disagrees with that.

>x structure
The View of Points is like one of those parking meter looking things you see at the edge of a cliff to magnify the landscape beyond. It's currently set to 1, though you can SWITCH it.

Expectations Meet

(ROOM ANNO) The irony of expectations meet is that if people gather together and discuss their expectations, they never quite meet them.

>x structure
!(ROOM ANNO) The irony

>x view
The View of Points is currently set to 1, though you can SWITCH it.
You've seen Expectations Meet already, but have another look?

Expectations Meet
People all discuss what they deserve to have and why they deserve it more than others. Well, most. There's some impressively nuanced false humility here, though you could never call anyone on it.

The vision blurs, and you look up from the View of Points, sadder but hopefully wiser.

>switch
(the view of points)
Perilous Siege
Some kind of combat is going on here! A big castle labeled BUSTER BALL'S PLACE is surrounded by forces that can only be the Baiter Master's. Nobody's getting killed, but the insults are coming fast from each side.
(ROOM ANNO) The Siege Perilous is where Galahad was allowed to sit. It signified virtue. Of course, many of the antagonists in the Compound think they have virtue, but they don't. Since this room was so general, I didn't see a way to include it in the game proper.

>switch
Robbery Highway
There's a speed limit sign here (45 MPH IF YOU'RE LAME, 75 IF YOU'RE NOT,) but it's just put there so anyone dumb enough to follow it will get mugged.
(ROOM ANNO) Highway robbery being a clear rip-off, I liked the idea of a location made especially for that.

>switch
Space of Waste
Piles and piles of things society apparently needs, but you have no use for. Magazines, mattresses, furniture, take-out boxes. A voice whispers: "But you do! People buy them, and if you invested in a company that sells them, that makes you money."
(ROOM ANNO) Like Mine Land, this is one of those areas that don't work well in a game, but all the same--so many spaces are space of waste.

>switch
Clown Class
One teen forcefully berates a class into how they're not funny, and they never will be, unless they shape up and start blending intelligence with social knowledge properly. And the way to start is to encourage people who are actually funny, but don't be a COPYCAT. He scoffs a lot at them, and assures them he's not laughing at their JOKES.
(ROOM ANNO) I had an idea of making Clown Class a dead end, or maybe even a separate game, but I couldn't pull it off.

>switch
Everything Hold
You see about one of everything you've ever owned or wanted to here. Considering it all makes you pause with jealousy--for what you don't have--and regret, for what you got and wasn't worth it.
(ROOM ANNO) The obvious pun here is that trying to hold everything physically often makes you hold everything in terms of time. So this seemed apt, but if I put anything in this room, I'd put in a lot, and that'd be way too much trouble to implement.

>switch
Shoulder Square
People mill about here in pairs, shoulder to shoulder. One of each pair always tells the other what he should have done.
(ROOM ANNO) I do like the pun shoulder/should, er. They mix well with shoulders tensing thinking what you should do.

>switch
Punishment Capitol
(ROOM ANNO) I'm opposed to capital punishment. And I think the Baiter Master is, too, though he does like to retaliate more vigorously than any (perceived) attack on him. I needed a place for the big crimes, and here it is. It's the place for the worst crimes, like attacking the Baiter Master. Obviously, it had to be.

The vision blurs, and you look up from the View of Points, sadder but hopefully wiser.

>switch
Hut Ten
(ROOM ANNO) I never got to implement as many deaths as I thought, but this was an obvious pun to conjure up images of Stalag 17 or something.

The vision blurs, and you look up from the View of Points, sadder but hopefully wiser.

>switch
A Beer Pound
(ROOM ANNO) This came up when I was looking for better names for the Sinister Bar (now the Soda Club) post-release. I wanted a place for alcohol-related offenses but had nowhere until this seemed a bit obvious.

The vision blurs, and you look up from the View of Points, sadder but hopefully wiser.

>switch
In-Dignity Heap
(ROOM ANNO) It's hard to be dignified on a heap, and the "in" prefix provides fodder for a lot of puns. I wasn't able to use this on an item, so there is a fake death location.

>switch
Shape Ship
(ROOM ANNO) What better place to get ship shape than on a shape ship? Again, the creative deaths/failures didn't pile up enough, but I still enjoyed imagining all this.

>switch
Criminals' Harbor
(ROOM ANNO) This pun was too good to pass up. Maybe I should've saved it for the sequel. Maybe I will anyway. It's delightfully seedy.

>switch
Maintenance High
(ROOM ANNO) Most people who complain about others being high maintenance usually are emotionally high maintenance themselves. So I imagined a place where people learned WHY they were high maintenance and had it beat into their skulls. If they learned quickly, see, it was right. If not, well, they're taking up teaching time. Where people doled out abuse and projected their own deficiencies on others.

>switch
(the view of points)
Fight Fair
The Baiter Master watches down from a video screen as much stronger people beat up on much weaker people. "Use your minds! Be grateful they're not really hurting you!" Nobody dares call it barbaric. After all, it could be worse.

(ROOM ANNO) Of course, none of the fights in Fight Fair are remotely fair, and fights at fairs in general are, well, rigged. It also seemed to be a good way to underscore pitting less popular kids against each other, or against a bully-henchman to grind them down.

The vision blurs, and you look up from the View of Points, sadder but hopefully wiser.

>switch
(ROOM ANNO) I felt very, very horrible thinking of this, for obvious reasons, and similarly, I didn't want to put this in the game proper and fought about including it in the Director's Cut. So you'll have to ANNO CAMP to see more.

(2) It took a bit of time to find the magic item to cross over into the truly odd bits. Originally it was the Proof of Burden, but that was too magical, too early. And that might've forced the mechanic on you. I think A Round Stick is a bit subtler. Plus it let me put two round things together.
