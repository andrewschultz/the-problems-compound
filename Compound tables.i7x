"'Dude, why do you read so much? It's sort of showing off.'"	"You are, for the moment, in English class. People are running circles around you discussing an assigned book. You overhear that YOU should be participating more, with all you used to read."	"You are outside an expensive charity dinner--not allowed in, of course. A grown-up version of the classmate who made fun of you in the past for reading blathers on about how reading books helps children become success stories."	true	true	true
"A teacher chides the class to be 'nice like Alec.' They aren't, at recess."	"Some fake contrarian says that just being nice isn't nearly enough, and it's so formulated."	"You face an onslaught of people who were apparently trying to be nice to you, but NO..."
"The rest of the class glares at your younger self for asking one too many 'why' questions."	"Classmates moan endlessly about research papers, and you figure there's probably some law against choosing a subject you'd like."	"A classmate all grown up espouses original dynamic thinking and how schools just don't do enough."
"A young version of a now ex-friend berates young you for a small inefficiency in code his father noted."	"The ex-friend, older now, wonders why you stink at big-picture programming for computer class despite writing that immaculate Quick Sort routine."	"The ex-friend is lecturing at a big conference now, about how coding is about flexibility and trading ideas, but there's still a great job market for low-level stuff most people totally fear."
"You feel slightly sick hearing what a smart young boy you are. Study hard, and the social stuff will work itself out later."	"You hear whispers that Alec may be smart, but he can't be bothered to, you know, work well with other people. People who do the organizational stuff."	"You're stuck listening to a self-help guru tape blathering how what REALLY matters is how well you work with other people, and if brainy types never bothered to get this, the worse for them."
"Your six-year-old self listens to a 'sophisticated' joke by eleven-year-olds you don't understand."

"Memories of fringe-group kids not willing to share their writing with such a math and science square."	"A vision of THAT guy hawking his 'creative' autobiography, which is total rubbish."
"Remembering the first time you kicked a kickball in the air. The bully waiting under it, saying don't bother to run. Dropping it and hitting you good, your teammates furious you didn't try."	"Smart semi-friends laughing at the bully flunking a grade. Drug problems."	"Advanced-class peers discuss why you're not on the career track you should be. The bully joins in, saying if HE had your chances...they agree."
"You fail to deal with James Scott and Scott James both laughing at you for reading in third grade."	"You remember Bradley George and George Bradley arguing if you are just lazy or clueless. It's unclear whether they'd rather acknowledge if you're in earshot, or not."	"In the future, you see co-workers Simon Terry and Terry Simon argue over whether you should be fired because you concentrate too much on details or too much on big things."
"You remember being guilt tripped for falling asleep in church and reading the whole Bible personally."	"Other kids tell you religion is for wimps, why take it seriously, throwing logic-busters like 'Can God make an immovable object?' at you."

"You picture a future employer saying, well, he can pretty much tolerate anything (with community awards to prove it) except, well, you."
"Hearing 'Don't think you're special, son. The sooner you learn that, the better,' back in third grade."	"Hearing you didn't really distinguish yourself with any special skills for the job market."	"Being around people who wondered why you didn't try for anything special, because you could've if you wanted to."
"'Why would anyone want to write something like THAT?!'"	"'Wow! You're trying to, like, appeal to normal people with this writing, but, um, no.'"	"'Say, why don't you write any more?'"
"You're picked apart for knowing weird facts that aren't on any quiz."	"In school, you feel bad you never have anything interesting to add to right answers."	"You feel lost in a game of Trivial Pursuit you feel you should be much better at."
"Teachers tell you to UNDERSTAND other kids might be mad you're smarter than they are."	"Teachers tell you don't get mad other people have better social skills. DO something, you're smart enough!"	"Peers ask why you just don't care about being social either way. THEY'RE trying to connect with you, but..."
"You're shouted down for missing an obscure grammar point."	"You're told that you are good at grammar and all, but you don't have an ounce of creativity."	"You notice someone has made a grammar checker that sells well, and others say you could've thought of it if you'd had ANY initiative."
"'The kid has no self-awareness!'"	"'The kid is too self-absorbed!'"	"'The guy never found a way to quit wallowing in private. Or complaining in public. Sad.'"

"You're assured, no matter what your political beliefs are, or how strongly you hold them, you'll know better when you get older."	"Peers explain that either they have better reasons to vote your way, or you're just too biased to see their voting logic. But they guess your vote deserves to count as much as they did."	"You are overwhelmed by people younger than you voting and canvassing with more enthusiasm than you ever did. They have to be right, with that enthusiasm."

1	"Well, you do need to be more dynamic in conversations. But that doesn't seem right. You wonder if you're just being lazy or unsocial or antisocial."
3	"Man. It's frustrating. People have pulled these moves on you. And you're pretty sure they're wrong. You've got no way to go around them. You wonder if maybe you need a LITTLE edge."
6	"Ugh. Surely that can't be the way to be? But people who mastered this, get ahead."
10	"It seems knowing these makes up for not knowing actual stuff. Maybe you are just jealous others put in the effort to look and be clever with more than just boring facts."

table of Bible references [xxbr]

"Explain to someone you're only attacking their behavior, but if they're too attached to that, maybe they need to change more than they think they did."
"Deliberately misunderstand someone who talks weakly. Give them a fake smile. Well, they'll need to learn to deal with that sort of thing SOME time!"
"Misunderstand someone blatantly to see if they react excitingly enough. If so, you may have a new associate!"
"Use 'fair enough' frequently to cool off someone who actually may have a point."
"Complain about something you can't say these days, but don't let your audience cut in too much."
"Pretend to misunderstand everyone even if they're clear. If they don't stick up for themselves, well, they need to learn."
"Use 'y'know' a lot, especially when berating unnecessary adverbs."
"Point out that someone thinks they're a special snowflake, but...give it your own special touch."
"Blast people for copying you, or for being too weird."
"Smack [']em down with 'It's called...' two or three times a day."
"Make your I CAN'T and YOU CAN'T equally forcible."
"If someone asks a potentially stupid question, ask them the embarrassing question WHY."
"Make people feel like they blew it and they never had it in the first place."
"Say people need to put first thing first, then laugh at every other thing they say."
"If you can make people feel their weirdness is forcing you to lie to them, good for you!"
"Pick out an unsocial skeptic and be skeptical they actually care."
"Tell people you're not a mind reader, then say you know what they're thinking."
"A single 'I'm not mad at you' can go a long way."
"'Don't get me wrong' puts the burden on THEM. If you don't think you deserve to use it, you don't. Don't take this the wrong way!"
"Be exciting when you refuse to apologize, and cut people down for boring apologies which don't make others feel better."
"Be okay once they get to know you around people it's not worth bothering to get to know."
"Some people aren't special, but they have special weird quirks. Don't let them off the hook!"
"Let people know when they need to take a hint and when stuff is in all their head."
"Assure people you get to the point, but be sure to laugh before responding. 'Is it something I said' is a good follow up question."

table of incisive sid viewpoints [xxisv]
sid-sez
"Sid spews a [activation of showerproof] of all sorts of things that can't be true. You wipe a bit of his spittle off your arm."
"Sid points out it's really probably better to be a jerk than not, because fake nice is really really creepy. Lee asks if it's the same for fake interesting. 'A-HA! I KNEW YOU WEREN'T NICE!'"
"Sid puts down Lee and notes your silence is agreement. But Lee has a comeback--and Sid notes your silence (again) as disbelief."
"Sid throws the old chestnut about how immovable objects and unstoppable forces can't both exist at once to prove an omniscient God is a contradiction."
"Sid proves scientists are lazy because they just aren't making enough elements quick enough. Chiseling from the government, really. Also, scientists are arrogant because they name elements after other scientists and not, like, pop culture."
"Sid takes an annoying stance espousing a political view you're opposed to, then an almost as annoying stance explaining one you agree with. You feel biased not being as appalled the second time."
"Sid argues TS Eliot really is toilets spelled backwards, because the TS should go together being in caps, and anyway, there aren't enough palindromes in the world."
"Sid wonders why people would spend ten minutes listening to a sermon in church. You mentally calculate how long you've been around him, or worse, how long Lee has."
"Sid is sure Ã‰variste Galois was smart to figure out all that stuff by the age of 21, but he was kind of dumb to get killed at 21 too, amirite?"
"Sid wonders if maybe mathematicians are being lazy about finding a quintic formula, though he can't even remember the quadratic, and he remembers the cubic formula was really messy."
"Sid doesn't fully believe in Godel's Incompleteness theorem. Perhaps mathematicians aren't trying hard enough to figure things out, or there's a conspiracy to keep cushy tenured jobs."
"Sid puts forth an appallingly simplistic view on taxes. Just when you think you've heard them all, wow."
"Sid points out the value of figuring out why things are messed up for yourself. Lee Bull asks for a moment about when Sid wasn't quite right...and Sid looks very offended indeed."
"Sid figures anyone who sells Connect 4 boards is part of a racket, since the game is solved and all, but he has better things to do than read the PROOF, you know."
"Sid wonders why computers haven't solved Checkers yet. When Lee informs him they already have, Sid wonders why there are still, apparently, checkers tournaments."
"Sid belittles people who think we can go faster than the speed of light as unscientific and those who don't as uncreative."
"Sid has harsh words for people who can do too much or too little math in their heads. He's--just about right. He knows, because, well, he has methods."

"Uncle Dutch and Turk discuss how and why to [activation of Rust Belt] from your white-collar ideals."

"Uncle Dutch takes a moment to commend Turk Young's youthful enthusiasm, with which Turk Young takes a moment to commend Uncle Dutch's wisdom."

"'That's some [activation of dutch reckoning]! More than I thought possible!'"
"'I'm equally hard on squares who don't drink and punks who drink too much.' / 'That's [activation of dutch courage]!'"
"Uncle Dutch and Turk praise the motivating power of [activation of fearlessness] to keep yourself important."
"Uncle Dutch and Turk discuss the right amount to be scared to be at your most productive, but if you achieve that, you'd better not feel you have nothing to be scared of."
"Uncle Dutch complains about lazy kids these days, and Turk Young complains about adults who are have given up on life. They then play agreement-pong about initiative in general is a good thing."

"Uncle Dutch and Turk discuss the etiquette of whether you should call the [bad-guy] [bg] or not. Well, YOU never should, and Turk isn't ready yet, but what a big day it will be in the near future when he is allowed!"
