1	"Well, you do need to be more dynamic in conversations. But that doesn't seem right. You wonder if you're just being lazy or unsocial or antisocial."
3	"Man. It's frustrating. People have pulled these moves on you. And you're pretty sure they're wrong. You've got no way to go around them. You wonder if maybe you need a LITTLE edge."
6	"Ugh. Surely that can't be the way to be? But people who mastered this, get ahead."
10	"It seems knowing these makes up for not knowing actual stuff. Maybe you are just jealous others put in the effort to look and be clever with more than just boring facts."

"Use 'fair enough' frequently to cool off someone who actually may have a point."
"Complain about something you can't say these days, but don't let your audience cut in too much."

table of incisive sid viewpoints [xxisv]
sid-sez
"Sid spews a [activation of showerproof] of all sorts of things that can't be true. You wipe a bit of his spittle off your arm."
"Sid notes how some people are true but strange, but he's all about strange but true."
"Sid points out it's really probably better to be a jerk than not, because fake nice is really really creepy. Lee asks if it's the same for fake interesting. 'A-HA! I KNEW YOU WEREN'T NICE!'"
"Sid mentions you can't call him [activation of Sid Vicious] because he keeps punks in line FAIRLY."
"Sid puts down Lee and notes your silence is agreement. But Lee has a comeback--and Sid notes your silence (again) as disbelief."
"Sid throws the old chestnut about how immovable objects and unstoppable forces can't both exist at once to prove an omniscient God is a contradiction."
"Sid proves scientists are lazy because they just aren't making enough elements quick enough. Chiseling from the government, really. Also, scientists are arrogant because they name elements after other scientists and not, like, pop culture."
"Sid takes an annoying stance espousing a political view you're opposed to, then an almost as annoying stance explaining one you agree with. You feel biased not being as appalled the second time."
"Sid argues TS Eliot really is toilets spelled backwards, because the TS should go together being in caps, and anyway, there aren't enough palindromes in the world."
"Sid wonders why people would spend ten minutes listening to a sermon in church. You mentally calculate how long you've been around him, or worse, how long Lee has."
"Sid wonders if he should be called something more formal, like [activation of loser]."
"Sid is sure Ã‰variste Galois was smart to figure out all that stuff by the age of 21, but he was kind of dumb to get killed at 21 too, amirite?"
"Sid wonders if maybe mathematicians are being lazy about finding a quintic formula, though he can't even remember the quadratic, and he remembers the cubic formula was really messy."
"Sid doesn't fully believe in Godel's Incompleteness theorem. Perhaps mathematicians aren't trying hard enough to figure things out, or there's a conspiracy to keep cushy tenured jobs."
"Sid puts forth an appallingly simplistic view on taxes. Just when you think you've heard them all, wow."
"Sid points out the value of figuring out why things are messed up for yourself. Lee Bull asks for a moment about when Sid wasn't quite right...and Sid looks very offended indeed."
"Sid figures anyone who sells Connect 4 boards is part of a racket, since the game is solved and all, but he has better things to do than read the PROOF, you know."
"Sid wonders why computers haven't solved Checkers yet. When Lee informs him they already have, Sid wonders why there are still, apparently, checkers tournaments."
"Sid belittles people who think we can go faster than the speed of light as unscientific and those who don't as uncreative."
"Sid has harsh words for people who can do too much or too little math in their heads. He's--just about right. He knows, because, well, he has methods."
"Sid mentions how he wants to go [activation of turing machine] at [activation of technology] so much more than Lee."

"'That's some [activation of dutch reckoning]! More than I thought possible!'"
"'I'm equally hard on squares who don't drink and punks who drink too much.' / 'That's [activation of dutch courage]!'"
"Uncle Dutch and Turk praise the motivating power of [activation of fearlessness] to keep yourself important."

"Uncle Dutch and Turk discuss the etiquette of whether you should call the [bad-guy] [bg] or not. Well, YOU never should, and Turk isn't ready yet, but what a big day it will be in the near future when he is allowed!"
