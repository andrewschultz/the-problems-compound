# the-problems-compound

post-comp repository for Andrew Schultz's IFComp 2015 game, The Problems Compound

Release 1 was September/October 2015, for IFComp.

Release 2 was on March 2016. It was intended as a bug-fixing release with some new features, including an alternate good ending and a few bad ones.

Release 3 is slated for August 2017. It was intended as a maintenance release to fix a bug that blocked certain bad food endings but grew into something where I changed a lot of names and also used Zarf's test scripts to make finer fixes to features such as annotation. The release notes have more details on all the text flips, but due to better testing (Zarf's tools and my own) I was able to find a lot more ideas.

I also split off the random tables into a separate file.

utils\ contains files for looking up words on thefreedictionary and sorting out source code. They've helped immensely with the extra text in release 3.

testing\ contains the text files for Zarf's scripts.

I make no guarantees about being able to build the game.
