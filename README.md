post-comp repository for Andrew Schultz's IFComp 2015 game, The Problems Compound

Release 2 was on March 2016. It was intended as a bug-fixing release with some new features including an alternate ending.

Release 3 slated for August 2016. It was intended as a maintenance release but grew into something where I changed a lot of names and also used Zarf's test scripts to make finer fixes to features such as annotation.

This contains test scripts and various spare ideas for Problems Compound.
