post-comp repository for Andrew Schultz's IFComp 2015 game, The Problems Compound

Release 2 was on March 2016. It was intended as a bug-fixing release with some new features including an alternate good ending and a few bad ones.

Release 3 slated for August 2016. It was intended as a maintenance release but grew into something where I changed a lot of names and also used Zarf's test scripts to make finer fixes to features such as annotation. It also tripled the word-flips in the game text, although some are obscure to find.

utils\ contains files for looking up words on thefreedictionary and sorting out source code. They've helped immensely with the extra text in release 3.

testing\ contains the text files for Zarf's scripts.
