"The Problems Compound" by Andrew Schultz

the story headline is "A Direction of Sense: changing what's-thats to that's-whats"

[Compound Tables.i7x now has a list of a lot of the random text in this game that was originally in the main file. It should be included with the GitHub project, or with the bundled release.

to search through this file, two x's at the start of a comment will delinate major points I revisit.

  other tables begin with xx and you can search for them. That way. Or with xx (first letter) in most cases. I put spaces in the index below so your first hit won't be, well, the index.
  bad guy worries, basher bible advice, horrible books, horrendous songs, sid's viewpoints, jerk girl talk, sleep stories

  2x add = stuff referred to tangentially and its explanations.
  2x cv = conceptville, where concepts you don't know about are, is not a table but contains all the definitions with how to get the concept in-game
  2x trt = ring tries (good ending)
  2x tht = hammer tries (best ending)

  if you are searching for how concepts are triggered, search for activation of, with a left bracket before it.

section more of my own modifications and definitions

Before asking someone to try doing something (this is the can't order others around rule):
	say "You're just not very good at giving orders, at all. [one of]People look at you funny whether you're polite or urgent about it. Worse, others less smart than you are far better at it. You'll be glad just to feel less ordered around once this is through.[paragraph break]In fact, you used to feel guilt-tripped GIVEing someone something, even something you needed to--'What! So you want something from me?' But not any more.[paragraph break]TLDR: maybe you can GIVE people stuff, but orders are out.[or]Your best bet is to GIVE people something.[stopping]" instead;

the reject commanding for talking rule is not listed in any rulebook.

a quip can be permissible. a quip is usually not permissible.

a quip can be talked-thru. a quip is usually not talked-thru.

a quip can be jerky. a quip is usually not jerky.

Procedural rule: ignore the print final score rule.

a thing can be abstract. a thing is usually not abstract.

a client is a kind of person. a client is usually male. a client can be specified. a client is usually not specified. a client has text called clue-letter. [specified = how to sort clients in the table]

a client can be minted. a client is usually not minted.

table of explanations [xxtoe] [alfbyroom]
exp-thing	exp-text	exp-anno
bad knot	"A bad knot is hard to untangle. You wouldn't say it's not bad to untangle. And 'not bad' can have several connotations, itself, from strong to faint praise. So you can tie yourself up thinking of what it means."	"I figured this out pretty late in release 3 when I wanted an insignia for the token." [start of smart street]
chess board	"Despite being a really good chess player, this always fooled me. I started with a queen in the corner as a kid and got run around, but then as an adult I recognized the virtue of going for an easy solution (no queens in the center) and seeing why it didn't work."	"Starting by disallowing the center 16 squares helped a lot--by sheer number, that's 21/23 squares each queen sees, not 25/27, and then placing any of the queens in the four 2x2 corners makes rows 3-6 unable to match up. Also, I didn't understand symmetry arguments e.g. it's useful to see if we can have a queen 2 from any corner, or one 3 from a corner. It's important not to think of this as 'laziness' if we can start building general principles or eliminate enough cases."
face of loss	"Loss of face means humiliation or loss of respect. A face of loss isn't an official idiom, but here it means you're just sad. You've lost some fun and curiosity."	"This is something I didn't discover until release 2. What's the best way for Alec to seem upset? In retrospect, 'a bad face' should've clicked things earlier, but it happened eventually."
Fly House	"A house fly is a dirty nuisance."	"The Fly House was Broke Flat, but I wanted somewhere more appetizing to enter."
FreeCell	"FreeCell is that game on Windows that was put in to help programmers learn about interfaces. It grew its own fan base, being winnable in almost any formation but still challenging."	"I wrote a text-based FreeCell game to learn Python after IFComp 2016, and as I did, it struck me how much I'd procrastinated with FreeCell over the years when it would've been more fun or challenging to write a game. I've used it to learn other languages, too. But it is like a drug--letting you win just enough to feel smart, tempting you to play again whether you won quickly (doesn't really count as wasting time...) or it took a while (need to end on a good note, winning quickly). So it didn't show up until release 3."
Game Shell	"A shell game is where an operator and possibly an assistant rig a game so that mugs think it's an easy win, but they can't. The most popular one is when they hide a bean under a hollowed shell and shift them around."	"The game shell is a shell game of its own. No matter how much you solve, you won't impress Guy Sweet, and you won't--well--figure the real puzzles you want to, beyond logic etc."
gesture token	"A token gesture is something done as a bare minimum of acknowledgement."	"There were all sorts of tokens this could have been. I decided on gesture because, well, you get something for doing the bare minimum."
hangman	"The strategy of hangman always interested me. I enjoyed finding tough words or even seeing how people squabbled over the rules: how many misses, etc. Of course, there is One Best Strategy, well, until you are up against people who know tricky words."	"Hangman was a late edition to release 3. I remember feeling guilty writing a PERL script to see what words were remaining when I had one guess left in an online game, but it was educational, for all that. And so I think it may be rather neat to look at in any case."
logic puzzles	"I remember marking up books of logic puzzles but thinking they could never ever be practical. I remember having a grease pen over clear plastic so the books could be reused, but I also remember the patterns getting a bit tedious. It wasn't until someone showed me a sample LSAT years later that I thought, really, these are the same thing. Or it's the same process of elimination. Suddenly lawyers seemed less intimidating."	--
match sticks	"I've always enjoyed match stick problems and how some just don't seem likely. While the general trick if not too many are moved is to shift the original picture onto the new one, somehow, there are creative ones with many shifts."	--
necklace	"The seven-link necklace really only has three possibilities: center, next to center, and next to edge, the edge being clearly silly. That said, I felt clever being able to work out the two-link problem on my own way back when, so I put it here."	--
Nim	"Nim was always the toughest to prove, and my 8th-grade self wiped out in Beyond Zork and I had to watch the trees for hints. Once I learned about Strong Induction, the proof made sense. Though I was still impressed anyone would come up with it."	--
out puzzle	"These aren't a pun, but it's something mathy people see a lot of, and motivational speakers tend to abuse it. If you'd like the solution to the four lines to draw to connect all the points, and even other smart-aleck answers, say yes."	--
river boat	"I remember being fooled by the river boat as a kid and then realizing the moves were forced. I was glad to find some variations and even make a decent one in my experimental game Turn Around for the Apollo 18 tribute. It's not big on story, but I like the puzzles and tricks."	--
Rubik's Cube	"The Rubik's Cube is always something I was supposed to be good at. My sister three years older than me bought a solving book I figured I'd be old enough to look at in three years. I never did. Not [']til I was an adult did I see the methods, and I was surprised how piecemeal and orderly it was. I also remember being very very jealous of Will Smith solving it in an episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air."	"The Rubik's Cube also has a theme of two things flipped making a big, big difference. That last pair is always a tricky one."
thought of school	"A school of thought is a particular way of thinking held by a specific group. Alec doesn't fit in with any, and so his thought of school is a bit intimidating. Also, a thought of school is generally not about the more philosophical things. If schools do focus on that, people tend not to think too hard about them. They just go ahead and do."	--
Towers of Hanoi	"ToH is a basic computer science problem, and I remember someone I respected raving how hard it was, and being disappointed how easy the recursive solution was: N to peg X = n-1 to peg Y, bottom to peg X, n-1 to peg Z. That said, it's just awful in practice."	--
off tee	"To tee off is to yell or punch out at someone."	-- [start of a round lounge]
person chair	"A chairperson is someone in charge of things. The person chair is, on the other hand, anonymous and plain."	--
Plan Hatch	"To hatch a plan is to figure a way to do something."	"This was the first real 'puzzle,' and it's not meant to be much of a puzzle. But there are plenty of escape the locked room ideas, and so I wanted to show Alec as learning at least a minimum. I was worried the round stick/screw might be too similar, but I really liked the switched where a noun became a verb and vice versa."
round screw	"To screw around is to do silly unproductive stuff."	--
round stick	"To stick around is to move nowhere."	--
Mouth Mush	"A mush-mouth is someone who talks unclearly or uses weak words."	-- [start of tension surface]
Absence of Leaves	"Leaves of absence means taking time off."	"I wanted Variety Garden to be plain, but I didn't know how to do it without implementation. This looked like a good joke in release 1, but it wasn't until release 2 that I really found the idea of brush, which is hard to tell apart, anyway." [start of variety garden]
aside brush	"To brush aside is to ignore someone as you move past them."	--
back brush	"To brush back is to repel someone or keep them out."	--
off brush	"To brush off is to ignore. It's more ignoring someone's ideas than ignoring them fully."	--
pocket pick	"A pickpocket is a thief."	"The pocket pick is also about the least possibly valuable item you could steal."
proof of burden	"The burden of proof means: you need to come up with evidence to prove your point."	"I had the idea of some sort of document early on, and the Burden of Proof always fascinated me as something others needed less than I did."
Rogue Arch	"An arch-rogue is a big bad guy, obviously inappropriate for early in the story."	--
earth of salt	"Salt of the earth means a great person. It's from back when salt was more valuable."	"This was earth of scum, but I decided that salt would be better, because it'd be more visual, and also it should be something nice and likable but it wasn't." [start of vision tunnel]
Flower Wall	"A wallflower is someone who doesn't participate socially."	"I had trouble with what this should be in the Vision Tunnel, but when I found it I realized it showed Alec being social."
picture hole	"Seeing the whole picture means you see everything."	--
Poor Dirt	"Dirt poor means especially not rich."	--
Basher Bible	"A bible basher is someone who quotes scripture too much. The reverse means a compendium of ways to try and gain power over people and put them down."	"I simply can't believe this one took so much to find! The idea is, people who sell you on your own inadequacy are at least as destructive as, well, Bible-Bashers. But they put on a show and make their audience glad THEY'RE not the ones being cut down, yet." [start of pressure pier]
boo tickety	"Tickety-boo means okay, all right, etc."	"I like the contrast of being told 'Boo!' with the horrible places you're shipped off to, elsewhere. Also, it makes it clear small mistakes are okay."
a sample stool	"A stool sample is a piece of matter from inside your butt."	"This came up late in release 3. I was reading a Twitter thread, the subject of which I won't reveal. A side stand seemed a bit too vanilla, and I was glad to have something to balance it."
a side stand	"To stand aside is to get out of the way."	"I had trouble with what was supporting the Basher Bible, until I stumbled on this. I'd thought of a stand for a while, but it seemed like there were too many choices. Then I realized I could just give a different figure of speech if you tried different things."
trail paper	"A paper trail is evidence in white-collar crimes. People often have to piece it together."	--
assignment plum	"A plum assignment is giving someone a particularly prestigious, noticeable, easy or lucrative job. It's one everyone wants."	-- [start of meal square]
basted lamb	"To be lambasted is to be yelled at very loudly."	--
charred pie	"A pie chart is a graphic that represents percents as part of a pie/circle divided into arcs."	--
condition mint	"Mint condition is brand new."	"The mint was buggy until release 3, but it was one of the first foods that made me realize Meal Square could be an important location."
cutter cookie	"Cookie-cutter means predictable and formulaic."	"I wound up getting rid of most of the foods I planned for release 1, but I added the whole 'Alec goes bad' on a whim and it went pretty well."
gagging lolly	"Lollygagging is waiting around."	"This is one of the worst puns with the silliest deaths. I'm proud of it!"
greater cheese	"A cheese grater chops up cheese. Also, you do become a bit of a grater if you eat it."	"This was the second of the post-comp bad foods added. It occurred to me that there are lots of ways to be a jerk."
iron waffle	"A waffle iron is what you put batter in to make a waffle. But a waffle is also what you use when you don't know what to say. An iron waffle, then, would be something to say when you don't know what to say--but it is hard to take down."	"Alec of course would not have the confidence to make or use an iron waffle."
Off Cheese	"To cheese someone off is to annoy them."	"I was pleased to see Hulk Handsome wrote Cheesed Off, which I think you'll like, too. Thankfully I checked PC into GitHub before Ryan Veeder's Exposition for Good Interactive Fiction, so I think we can say the two of us both had our own takes on the pun. This was the first of the post-comp bad foods added. It's a failure for Alec in the sense that he becomes the sort of complainer he might be impressed by, but they're not actually BETTER than he is."
opener eye	"An eye-opener is something that makes you realize things. The bad grammar here indicates that your eye, more open, is not really that way, or it's open the wrong way."
picture of a dozen bakers	"A baker's dozen is thirteen, thus counting for the illusion."	"I have no idea what this illusion would look like if drawn, but I wanted to put it there."
points brownie	"Brownie points are unofficial credit for helping or flattering someone."	"It occurred to me it could be horrible for Alec to try and make friends with the [bad-guy] and thus get the totally wrong ending. I think there's a lot of that, that people like the [bad-guy] try to convince you they're on your side, and so forth. Writing the ending squicked me out more than I thought it would."
spoon table	"A tablespoon is a small measure of something, usually for a recipe."	"The table is bigger than a spoon of course. It originally supported the Basher Bible but seemed more appropriate in Meal Square once I found a replacement."
thyme burger	"BurgerTime is a retro arcade game where Peter Pepper, the protagonist, goes around shaking pepper at enemies and stepping on burgers to prepare them."	"This is a dumb joke I enjoyed."
Tray A	"Just a tray, contrasted with Tray B."	--
Tray B	"Eating anything on it may betray who you really are."	"This is another thing that dropped out in release 2 and I couldn't believe it was that simple. People were disappointed I didn't clue that it was such a bad idea to eat the Cutter Cookie."
up gum	"To gum up is to slow down a process, often to a halt. I do like cheap silly deaths, too."	"It's always tough to judge if something is too obvious to include or too obvious not to. The main thing is, make sure you do it right with a few side joke riffs. I'm pleased with how I moved in the law enforcement here."
dreadful penny	"A penny dreadful is a trashy novel."	-- [start of down ground]
warmer bench	"A bench warmer is someone who doesn't get into the action, especially in a sports game."	"This may have been fueled by the sleep I needed trying to meet the IFComp deadline. But I've always wanted to try writing a side-dream world, and the idea of SLEEPing into the tense future/past/perfect came quite early on."
fly bar	"A barfly is someone who goes around to bars and gets drunk."	"This was a candidate for the bar name, but it seemed too obvious." [start of joint strip]
Minimum Bear	"Bare minimum is the very least you need to do to get by."	"The old Office Space routine about the bare minimum has stayed with me, especially because I worried about doing the bare minimum to seem I wasn't doing the bare minimum."
Pigeon Stool	"A stool pigeon is someone who tattles."	"The Stool Toad came first, but there was the question of what he sat on."
stickweed	"Stickweed is a generic term for wild plants with various odd fruit, like ragweed (thanks, dictionary.com)."	"I can't believe it took me three releases to find this! It's a nice little cheapo, though."
cooler wine	"A wine cooler is very low in alcohol content."	"I think there's no shortage of silly drink names, and I remember high school days of people poking someone for actually getting wasted on wine coolers." [start of soda club]
haha brew	"Brouhaha is a commotion or noise."	"Puns make me giggle much more than alcohol ever could. Also, the sort of laughs alcohol gives are frequently not too pleasant."
Rehearsal Dress	"A dress rehearsal is the final staging of the play before the audience sees it."	"I'm generally suspicious of fashion that Just Seems Right. The dress is intended to be tasteful but maybe too much in the general style."
chase paper	"A paper chase is excessive paperwork. In this case, work not strictly needed to reach Cute Percy."	"I love puns riffing on bureaucracy, and this was a good one. I'm pleased with this puzzle because it's a simple parity one based on actual physical reality. Too often you can go diagonally 1.4 times as fast as straight. This is neat for Reti's endgame puzzle, but not physically realistic. And I liked having a realistic puzzle in the middle of the abstract murk." [start of chipper wood]
bad face	"The bad face will help you face a bad...something. Also, 'bad' in the Michael Jackson sense of, I did/can do something cool."	"This is meant to show Alec's emotional development. He's figured out something tough, and he's confident about that. But he also doesn't need this to go through the Compound." [start of the belt below]
energy waist	"To waste energy is to do something without positive result. Or it can mean a machine is inefficient."
Insanity Terminal	"Terminal insanity is having no chance to regain sanity[if terminal is moot]. As for the puzzle: it is inspired by Jim Propp's Self-Referential Aptitude Test, which is well worth a look (http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/srat.html is one place to find it,) but a good deal more complex[end if]."	"I always wanted to write a puzzle like this, but yeah, in release 1, it was dropped in there."
crocked half	"Half-crocked means drunk."	"This was a bugging doodle for a while until I found something better. You need a lot of placements like that, sometimes." [start of A Great Den]
legend of stuff	"The Stuff of Legend means a book about great tales of yore, as opposed to the scribble-hint-book you get."	"This was another thing that sounded great but didn't seem to fit in anywhere--or seemed too obvious--until I decided to go ahead with the puzzle. It appeared in release 2, taking the functionality of the notes crib."
notes crib	"To crib notes is to copy from someone who was at a lecture."	--
Story Fish	"A fish story is a long winding story."	"The story fish was based on Billy Big Mouth Bass and meant to be as funny-if-it's-not-real." [start of disposed well]
yards hole	"The whole nine yards means everything."	"I have a feeling I missed some idioms, but this one I like because it really can be visualized."
blossoms	"Now that the blossoms are in place, well, it'd be mean to say a blossom is 'some blah.' Oops."	"Flowers are always a safe bet for showing life and decency and all. Just don't make it too cheesy." [start of classic cult]
Googly bowl	"To bowl a googly is to throw someone for a loop."	"I remember a Jerry Seinfeld American Express commercial where he looks to 'learn the lingo' and winds up saying 'That was a wicked googly!' It's still stuck with me, that and the one where goes over $20 filling up for gas but then flashes his card triumphantly. Oh, and the one where he has 31 cents to buy a stamp and has everything except an extra penny."
mind of peace	"Peace of mind means being able to think."	--
Trade of Tricks	"Tricks of the Trade are things that outsiders to a specialty probably don't know that are a bit out of the range of common sense."	"I've read a lot of tricks-of-trade books but most of them are about how you can sucker other people. I have read very few how not to get suckered books, so I decided to put one in here." [start of truth home]
Cold contract	"To contract a cold is to get sick. Also, the contract is pretty cold-blooded."	-- [start of scheme pyramid]
Deal Clothes	"To close the deal means to agree to terms."	"I have a special love for the homonyms I found. They required leaps on my part, and I searched them out aggressively."
fund hedge	"A hedge fund is for super rich people to get even richer."	--
money seed	"Seed money helps an investment. Of course, very few seeds are shaped like a dollar bill."	--
Finger Index	"The index finger is the one next to your thumb. Also, to finger someone means to point them out."	"We've all had secret notes and tabs on everyone else in junior high, and we've been on them or worried about them. This was a sort of slam book. I do think that having tabs on others is something we carry to adulthood, and it helps more in a career than it should." [start of accountable hold]
Sound Safe	"Safe, sound means being out of trouble. Also, the safe isn't very sound, as it's easy to open."	--
Fright Stage	"Stage fright is being scared to get out in front of a crowd."	"I've never been a fan of scaring someone into action. I often feel that people who say they are don't really want to help someone, or never learned it doesn't work." [start of speaking plain]
relief light	"Light relief would be a silly joke."	-- [start of temper keep]
Spleen Vent	"To vent one's spleen is to let our your anger."	"I knew you needed to stuff something down that vent for a while, but I didn't know what."
case basket	"A basket case is a slightly nasty term for someone who doesn't get out much and isn't very good socially." [start of court of contempt]
long tag	"To tag along is to follow behind."	"Between this and a long string, I thought I overused long in the flips, so I was glad I found the Circular."
the Reasoning Circular	"Circular Reasoning is, for instance, I'm smart because I'm clever because I'm smart."	"This might be my favorite flip. It sounds very deep, but circular reasoning is very seductive."
Drug Gateway	"A gateway drug leads you to bigger drugs, but here, the gateway may be blocking you from them."	"Drug humor can be in iffy taste, and making Alec a mule felt iffy, but he does need to learn there are some rules worth breaking, or things worth trying. Besides, Fritz deserves a bit of help." [start of walker street]
long string	"To string along someone is to keep them trying or asking for more."	"The string obviously had possibilities for moving somewhere. I thought about making a maze with a string, but Jim Aikin sort of did that in [i]The White Bull[r]."
Mistake Grave	"A grave mistake is a very bad mistake indeed."	"The mistake grave is deliberately nasty to people who don't take enough risks. That's their fault, but it is also the fault of people who take a lot of risks and are jerks about it and set bad examples and convince you you have to be exciting to take big risks."
Language Machine	"Machine Language is very low-level, unreadable (without training) code of bits. No English or anything."	"Some people objected to the machine as being about parser versus choice, but I tried largely to stay away from that. I just liked the image of making a machine happy. And in general I feel it's better to find what sort of game you can write that hasn't been written yet, instead of worrying what art can or should be. I hoped the general silliness would make this clear, but in release 2 I tried to touch things up to avoid misunderstandings." [start of standard bog]
Law Sods	"Sod's Law is also known as Murphy's Law, especially in the UK. In other words, what can go wrong, will. However, Murphy's Law was really that people will always find a reasonable way to do something wrong, though people now use the two interchangeably in the US. TMYK!"
Trick Hat	"A hat trick, in hockey or soccer, is scoring three times."	"This was originally just lying around, then you wore it to do something--but I wanted Alec not to have to rely on any tricks to beat the [bad-guy]."
Witch Sand	"A sandwich is two pieces of bread with something in between."
Poory Pot	"Potpourri, which smells good. Of course, I've read about pipe and cigar snobs who babble on about aromas and such, and apparently there are marijuana snobs too in this progressive time! Perhaps there always were."	"I'm aware of the mispronunciation, but when I was a kid, that's how I mispronounced it, too." [start of pot chamber]
wacker weed	"A weed whacker is the slang for a gardening tool to cut weeds."	"I like the thought of poor Fritz reduced to buying generics, though I suspect he doesn't have a sophisticated palate. It took a while before I accepted that I was going to put drugs in my game, but the more I've learned of the War on Drugs, the more I've seen it's not really about health--and the dealers often aren't really concerned much with clients['] rights or safety."
Book Bank	"A bankbook records numbers and is very un-literary."	"This was a book crack, but a bank feels more contrary to literature." [start of discussion block]
Poetic Wax	"To wax poetic is to, well, rhapsodize with poems or song or whatever. It's slightly less gross than wax."	"There are quack creams for everything these days. Why not for creativity, too? And why not have it work in an imaginary land?"
Song Torch	"A Torch Song is about looking back on a love you can't quite let go of. The Song Torch is more cynical than that, being a bit rougher on its subjects, and, well, actually torching them."	"This was the Song Swan in release 1, which was something, but I think the Song Torch is a bit more focused on pop songs, and besides, I already had a mechanical talking animal with the Story Fish."
Intuition Counter	"Counterintuition means the opposite of what you'd expect. Wait, that could mean counterintuition could mean something crazy. If something's counterintuitive, it works the opposite way you'd expect it to on first glance."	"There are lots of counters that could've been included, but I like how this makes the person intuiting unapproachable, whether or not their assumptions make immediate sense." [start of judgment pass]
Ability Suit	"Suitability means appropriateness. And the suit is not appropriate for the monkey."	"The suit is, of course, contrastable with the Labor Child's clothes as a bit of a hint." [start of idiot village]
fourth-blossom	"To blossom fourth is to grow."	"I have a sense I left a few number pun/flips on the table, but I got this one, I think."
lifted face	"Facelifted means you had surgery done on your face, though Alec's lifted more naturally."	--
service memorial	"A memorial service is what is held to remember someone fondly."
Thoughts Idol	"Idle thoughts, e.g., a wandering mind, are what it purports to oppose."	"I was disappointed the Compound didn't have enough surveillance, and I wanted to put it in the Village, but I didn't want it to just be there. And I wanted a way to beat it."
Trap Rattle	"A rattle trap is a cheap car."	"This felt like the weakest of my items to barter until I realized what it could be used for. I like that, apparently, rattles are for babies, but it shuts up petulant attention-hogging."
against rails	"If someone rails against something, they're upset with it."	"These were in the Variety Garden until release 2, when I realized they'd be better off somewhere more mechanical--oh, and I found the brush, too." [start of freak control]
call curtain	"A curtain call is when someone comes back out after lots of applause."	--
duty desk	"Desk duty is often what police officers are demoted to after a negative incident on the street."	--
frenzy feed	"A feed(ing) frenzy is a vicious attack, physical or emotional, by animal predators or people."	--
incident miner	"A minor incident is not a big deal, but the incident miner makes a big deal of small things."	--
Language Sign	"Sign language is how people communicate with the deaf."	"The language sign is pretty forceful. Plus, I wanted another easy way to tell the player what to do, though they could look around if they wanted to."
list bucket	"A bucket list has things to do before you die."	"This was a big engine in pushing changes for release 2. The [bad-guy] was just sort of there in release 1. But I spruced him up, and I needed something plausible that didn't throw you the list of items to look at too directly."
shot screen	"A screenshot is a graphical capture of what's on your computer screen at the moment."	--
Twister Brain	"The opposite of a brain twister, where someone derives a conclusion from a fact, the brain has a set conclusion and twists and weights facts to line up with them."	--
Witness Eye	"Someone at the scene of the crime."	--
worm ring	"A ringworm is a form of parasite."	"This was originally the wood worm, and it needed to become a whole worm, but I didn't see how to do it. I decided eventually to say it was a whole worm, but you needed to un-bend it, somehow." [start of out mist]
hammer	"The hammer can be three things[ham-desc]."	"Figuring what the hammer should be was a design puzzle for sure. I got a lot of bad puns from it, but the idea of actually having a puzzle that uses word-flipping seemed like a nice way to end the game." [start of airy station]
lock caps	"I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT CAPS LOCK IS, BUT HERE'S A DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LEAVE IT ON."	"I love a joke about all caps, and I needed some way to prevent you from getting in the carriage immediately."
mentality crowd	"Crowd mentality is when everyone believes and does the same thing."
Return Carriage	"Carriage Return is going back to the start of a new line in a document with text. And you are sort of going back to the start, too."	"The Return Carriage was originally the Snowflake Special. That's a good phrase, but it didn't feel right here. The Carriage is obvious, for what it is."
maple	"This is a bad one, with 'LE MAP' if you examine it. Yup. That's it." [start of muster pass]
pen fountain	"A fountain pen is (these days) a typical pen. You don't have to dip it in ink to keep writing. It's less exotic than a pen fountain, of course." [start of Eternal Hope Springs]
consciousness stream	"Stream of consciousness is a form of writing that relies heavily on inner monologue."	"It turns out that Nigel Jayne wrote a game called Gaia's Web which features a Consciousness Stream that actually blends into the game better, so you should definitely give that a check." [start of Brains Beat]
View of Points	"Points of view are opinions." [start of Window Bay]

table of explanations (continued) [xxtoe] [alfbyroom] [the people]
exp-thing	exp-text	exp-anno
Alec Smart	"A smart alec is someone who always has a clever quip."	"I didn't have a character for a while until I heard the phrase 'smart alec.' Once I did, I saw how it could work--he just liked being called Alec, but he had an unfortunate last name. A bit later I realized AS was Andrew Schultz." [start of smart street]
Guy Sweet	"Guy Sweet is more of a candy-[a-word] than a sweet guy, but 'sweet guy' is such a terrible compliment as-is. To yourself or others."	--
Word Weasel	"A weasel word is something that seems to mean more than it should."	"I like stories with talking animals, and at Alec's age, people look down on them, so it made sense to subvert that with a mean talking animal." [start of variety garden]
Terry Sally	"Terry Sally has two possible translations: salutary or solitary. He is sort of in between salutary (greeting) and solitary (alone) which fits in with how he probably doesn't get to see many people, but he's social when he does."	"Terry Sally was just the Howdy Boy before release 3. But I wanted to make the Compound a bit more personable." [start of pressure pier]
Fritz the On	"On the fritz means on the blink."	"I'm proud of finding this preposition at the end. I do like poking fun at thinking you're cosmically in tune but aren't. He's probably the NPC I have the most affection for, whether or not you actually do anything to save him." [start of down ground]
Stool Toad	"A toadstool is a mushroom."	"The ST has no proper name because he is a shadowy authority figure. Plus, he's very lazy, just sitting there." [start of joint strip]
Ally Stout	"A stout ally is someone who is on your side no matter what. Ally is, I'm afraid, a bit of a fake."	"The Punch Sucker was the bartender's name through release 2, but it always felt a bit contrived and more like a customer. Ally's name makes it obvious he's, well, on everyone's side." [start of soda club]
Erin Sack	"Saccharine means uncomfortably sweet."	"As much as I liked Liver Lily, this captures things better. Both men and women can be saccharine like this to get you to agree with them. I suppose Aaron Sack would've been an alternative, too."
Cain Reyes	"To raise Cain is to be loud."	-- [start of nominal fen]
Dandy Jim	"Jim Dandy is something excellent."	--
jerks	"[if allow-swears is false]A collective groan is when everyone groans at once[else]. A circle jerk is people getting together and stroking each other's egos. Or, well, something else[end if]. Pick one of the [j-co] by name to see details."	"Figuring out jerk names that fit the puzzle was an arduous thing, and I had many false starts in the final week before IFComp. The result was probably a few actual bugs slipping through."
Paul Kast	"To cast a pall is to give an air of unhappiness."	--
Quiz Pop	"A pop quiz is when a teacher gives an unannounced quiz on materials."	"Of course, we've all had caffeinated cram-sessions for a big paper or exam. Here this is a reward for stuff done."
Silly Boris	"Bore us silly."	--
Warm Luke	"Lukewarm is not really warm."	--
Warner Dyer	"A dire warner has a message for you to keep away."	--
Wash White	"To whitewash is to wipe clean."	--
Cute Percy	"To persecute someone is to make them suffer for who they are[if cute percy is moot]and right per se means literally right, but that's not what matters[end if]."	"Percy was the Assassination Character pre-release 3, but the problem is, he never got close to killing anyone. Still, the name gave me laughs." [start of chipper wood]

table of annotations [toa]
anno-num	exam-thing	anno-loc	anno-long (text)
0	--	Smart Street	"The idea for Smart Street came surprisingly late, but the reverse made total sense. The main point is that Alec may not be street smart, but people often assume he'll wind up somewhere around clever people. And of course Alec does not feel at home even though it shares a name with him." [very start]
0	--	A Round Lounge	"This came to me pretty late. I'm never quite sure how to start games. It always seems the best idea comes at the end, and yet on the other hand it's not fully comforting that I know how my story will end. I wanted you to start pretty normally, but move to progressively odder places."
0	--	Tension Surface	"This may've been a throwaway idea at first, but it grew on me as a noun that I hadn't used. You can examine the MOUTH MUSH for more commentary." [start intro]
0	--	Variety Garden	"The title was just for silliness until release 2, when I added varieties of brush. Basically, the garden has a lot of variety of brush, but not really quality, or nothing interesting. Originally there was a Stream of Consciousness and Train of Thought here, but these were placeholders and they didn't really flip. But they helped me until I found things. Like the Word Weasel, which didn't come until later, but I always liked that phrase. I went through a bunch of vegetables to put in the garden before I found an animal would do just as well."
0	--	Vision Tunnel	"I'm pleased with the flip here from 'tunnel vision' as the vision tunnel opens you up to the different ways to see things."
0	--	Pressure Pier	"This shuffled around a bit until I found someone who was adequate for pressuring you, as opposed to just talking you down. That was Terry Sally, who was the Howdy Boy for a long time. And, in fact, he was just 'there' in Sense Common for a while. Early I took a 'best/worst remaining pun' approach to the map, but as I started writing code and sending the game to testers, I realized how it could make more sense." [start outskirts]
0	--	Meal Square	"This was the Tactics Stall (bumped to Slicker City then Buck the Past) for a while, until I had enough food items for a separate area, and then I didn't have enough time to implement tactical items. I needed a place to put them. 'Sink kitchen' didn't quite work, but eventually I found this. The dozen bakers were my first scenery implemented, and I'm quite pleased at the bad pun. Also, the Gagging Lolly was the first silly-death thing I implemented."
0	--	Down Ground	"Some locations didn't make the cut, but they helped me figure out better ones. However, Down Ground was one of the first and most reliable. It was behind Rejection Retreat, which--well--didn't fit the pattern, though it was another name I liked[if ever-anno is false].[paragraph break]You can now JUMP to or from random areas that didn't quite make it. Actually, you could've once you turned on annotation mode. But now you know you can[end if]."
0	--	Joint Strip	"Sometimes the names just fall into your lap. It's pretty horrible and silly either way, isn't it? I don't smoke pot myself, but I can't resist minor drug humor, and between Reefer Madness and Cheech and Chong, and people too stridently opposed to or in favor of drug legalization, there is a lot of fertile ground out there."
0	--	Soda Club	"[one of]I forget what medieval text I read that made me figure out the Sinister Bar, but that's what it was in release 1. Some authors in the forum said, well, this is a bit awkward, and they were right, but it was the best idea I had and not worth holding up the game for a year. The thing is: it was an obvious weakness, but I had confidence I'd figure it out post-release. ANNO CLUB for more.[or]Then one day at the grocery store, I saw club soda, thought--could it be that easy? Having an ironic title for a speakeasy? It was! And I'd probably seen it before, but it didn't click.[paragraph break]There's a lesson here. I've spent a lot of time wondering if an idea is too complex or too simple, or too good to be true. And of course you can't be overconfident, but if it feels right, if feels right. Easy ideas don't fall out every day, but when they do, don't turn them down or worry if you haven't done enough to deserve them.[paragraph break]Of course, I'd probably have seen Soda Club if I started earlier. But that's another lesson.[cycling]"
0	--	Tense Past	"These three rooms fell pretty quickly once I heard 'past tense.' Dreams have often been a source of helplessness for me, with one 'favorite' flavor being me as my younger self knowing what I know now, knowing I'd get cut down for using that knowledge. That snafu has grown amusing over the years, but it wasn't as a teen." [sleepytime rooms]
0	--	Tense Present	"Of course we've all had dreams about stuff we can't do now, or issues that keep coming up. I'd like to think that my bad dreams, once I confronted them, let me exaggerate things for humor in everyday conversation. Still, it's been a developing process."
0	--	Tense Future	"We all worry about the future and what it will be, and we get it wrong, but that doesn't make it any less scary. I included this once I saw that dreams and fears could be traced into three segments: how you messed up, how you are messing up, and how you won't be able to stop messing up."
0	--	Nominal Fen	"The Nominal Fen was the Jerk Circle for a long time until the end of release 3, when I started cleaning up names. Then I realized I hadn't used the Mellow Marsh, which was great for after the jerks left. But what about before? I plowed through various types of terrain. Fen stuck, and nominal worked well especially because I couldn't quite describe a fen. Also, the idea of Jerk Circle made me laugh until I realized it might be a bit too icky to see too much, so I decided to break it off. Even with the Groan Collective as an adequate non-risque replacement. This way, the locations make (relative) sense even with the jerks/groaners gone. Of course, when you know the 'other' name is Jerk Circle, there are still connotations. But the image of one person starting to groan encouraging others is very apt. Once I saw how the NPCs could interact, I felt even more amused." [main area]
0	--	Chipper Wood	"I got the idea for this when reminded of a certain Coen Brothers movie. The contrast of violence and happiness in the title made me realize it was a better choice than Rage Road, which it replaced." [west-a-ways first]
0	--	Disposed Well	"This was originally the preserved well, and the Belt Below was below it. There was going to be a Barrel of the Bottom that opened, but it seemed too far-fetched. So I just went with a well where you couldn't quite reach something."
0	--	Classic Cult	"Of course, a cult never calls itself a cult these days. It just--emphasizes things society doesn't. Which is seductive, since we all should do it on our own, and we'd all love to find something quick and simple that helps us. But whether the thinking is New or Old, it remains. It can be dogma, even if people say it all exciting.[paragraph break]Plus I cringe when someone replies 'That's classic!' to a joke that's a bit too well-worn or even mean-spirited."
0	--	Truth Home	"Of course, the truth home has lots of truth--it's just all misused. And I liked the idea of a name that sounds a bit superior but isn't. Sid and Lee felt like they should have abstract names--and they did until release three, when I realized they were the last two that didn't. I had put their original names in Slicker City as authors, but when I looked at the list of 100+ to see who might be a good character for SC and didn't deserve to get lost in the random shuffle, I realized they could go in PC."
0	--	Scheme Pyramid	"I find pyramid schemes endlessly funny in theory, though their cost is real and sad. They're worse than lotteries. I'd originally intended to have more people here, but it didn't work out that way. The Labor Child does have a 'downline' of his own, in the other kids he's blackmailing."
0	--	Accountable Hold	"I'm critical of Big Business and people who think they've done a lot more than they have because they have a good network they don't give much back to. In particular, if someone talks about accountability, it's a sad but safe bet that in a minute they will start blaming less powerful people for things out of their control. There's a certain confidence you need for business, but too often it turns into bluster. In this case the only people held accountable are the jerks, for unusual things they like."
0	--	The Belt Below	"I wanted a seedy underbelly. And I got one. I didn't know what it was for, and certainly, it didn't all come together in the initial release. I just found a puzzle with a week before IFComp, and I got it to work. But the room name spurred me to make a puzzle that FELT unfair. In subsequent releases, I cleaned it up a bit."
0	--	A Great Den	"I forget when the idea of giving you a powerful item if you got abstract puzzles came to me. But I wanted the item to be powerful and cleverly named. I don't know if the room was at first (Bottom Rock). I wasn't sure where I could put a crib, because I couldn't implement a bedroom, but then I realized it could be just dropped anywhere, to show the Problems Compound is not for babies--or maybe to insinuate that hints are for babies. I mean, for the [bad-guy] to insinuate, not me. I use them a lot, too. Sometimes it's the difference between being blocked and seeing the author was quite close to their original vision, and with A Great Den/Bottom Rock, I spent a few sessions thinking I'd like to do something, but I didn't know what. Eventually, the word 'den' seemed pliable, and from then it was a matter of finding words beginning with DEN."
0	--	Judgment Pass	"This seemed as good a generic place-you-need-a-puzzle-to-get-by as any. Especially since I wanted solutions to focus around outsmarting instead of violence or pushing someone out of the way. I just needed someone officious to be blocking you, and that was Officer Petty." [east-ish]
0	--	Idiot Village	"Of course, the people here aren't total idiots, even if they are very silly. But I liked the idea of turning 'village idiot' on its head, as well as having a caste of 'outs' who maybe weren't stupid but let themselves be treated that way."
0	--	Service Community	"I liked the idea of an underclass that needs to rebel, and Idiot Village was good enough for getting the game out there. But then while playing Kingdom of Loathing, which has 'inspired' a lot of my 'jokes,' the Community Service challenge path's name kept pinging me. About the hundredth time, I smacked my head and said, oh, of course."
0	--	Speaking Plain	"The people here do go in for plain speaking, but that doesn't mean it's good speaking. In general, Alec is assaulted by a bunch of people who want to convince him they're wasting their time speaking to him than the other way around. They act like advertisements, to me. I no longer feel as trapped as I used to between people bossing you around with plain speech versus people bossing you around with lofty speech, but I remember it being very painful." [north-ish]
0	--	Temper Keep	"Temper Keep is one of those ideas that came relatively late, but once it did, I had a few adjectives and verbs that tipped me off to a quick puzzle that should be in there."
0	--	Questions Field	"This was originally the Way of Right, which was sort of close to Freak Control, but then close to release I was searching for other names and this popped up. I liked it better--the three Brothers are asking questions, first of you and then of why they're there and how they could leave--and it seemed less generic. And of course they're hearing questions--loaded ones. So it stayed."
0	--	Court of Contempt	"As someone intimidated and confused by all the yelling that went on in law-firm shows when I was younger, and as someone who thought I never could, any sort of court always seemed fearful to me. What would I be doing there? I was shocked when I got my first parking ticket and went in to protest that it was relatively quiet and orderly. (I got it overturned.) But the memory of younger fears still remains, funnier now."
0	--	Walker Street	"Walker Street was Crazy Drive in release 1. But I found the joke of somewhere plain or boring too much to resist, especially after finding 'Walker Street' as a stray annotation to delete in my Trizbort map file. Oh, a streetwalker is, well, someone who trades favors for money. Yes, THAT sort of favor."
0	--	Discussion Block	"This was the Interest Compound in release 1, but that was too close to the title once I changed it from the Directors of Bored. The discussions, of course, block any real discussion. The books and songs are meant to be wrong, but you as Alec can't SAY that, and Art and Phil claim they 'make you think.' Better to have books that help or let you think, I say."
0	--	Standard Bog	"This was something entirely different until the end. Something different enough, it might go in a sequel. But being a bog, I realized that'd make it a handy dead end."
0	--	Pot Chamber	"Some room names made me smile with their subtlety. Others, with their utter lack. Since this combines two awkward conversation subjects, guess which it was?"
0	--	Freak Control	"This was one of those rooms that made me realize I had a game. And I think the false humility in it ties up an important thing: the Baiter claims he's a bit of a dork, but he's like moderate and stuff. Except when he needs to be extreme to win an argument. The for-your-own good of how he went through it adds to the pile."
0	--	Out Mist	"I needed a name for a final location, and originally it was the Haves Wood, which didn't quite make sense. It needed to be somewhere shadowy--unclear. Then I overheard someone saying 'Boy, you missed out,' and I wanted to thank them, but they would've thought it was weird. The wordplay is, of course, that you missed out a bit, but the mist is still out of bounds for people in the Compound."
0	--	Airy Station	"Since stationary means lack of motion and you are leaving, I liked the contradiction. I wanted a way for people to say thanks for Alec before he left, if he did enough, as opposed to him just sneaking out as was the only way in release 1."

anno-num	exam-thing	anno-loc	anno-long (text)
0	--	Everything Hold	"The obvious pun here is that trying to hold everything physically often makes you hold everything in terms of time. So this seemed apt, but if I put anything in this room, I'd put in a lot, and that'd be way too much trouble to implement."
0	--	Mine Land	"I definitely don't want to trivialize the devastating effects of land mines. And from a technical viewpoint, Mine Land would probably have been an empty room. But really, a bunch of people crying 'Mine! Mine!' is destructive in its own way."
0	--	Robbery Highway	"Highway robbery being a clear rip-off, I liked the idea of a location made especially for that."
0	--	Space of Waste	"Like Mine Land, this is one of those areas that don't work well in a game, but all the same--so many spaces are space of waste."
0	--	Clown Class	"I had an idea of making Clown Class a dead end, or maybe even a separate game, but I couldn't pull it off."
0	--	Shoulder Square	"I do like the pun shoulder/should, er. They mix well with shoulders tensing thinking what you should do."
0	--	Perilous Siege	"The Siege Perilous is where Galahad was allowed to sit. It signified virtue. Of course, many of the antagonists in the Compound think they have virtue, but they don't. Since this room was so general, I didn't see a way to include it in the game proper."
0	--	Expectations Meet	"The irony of expectations meet is that if people gather together and discuss their expectations, they never quite meet them."
0	--	Camp Concentration	"[one of]I felt very, very horrible thinking of this, for obvious reasons, and similarly, I didn't want to put this in the game proper and fought about including it in the Director's Cut. So you'll have to ANNO CAMP to see more.[or]I wasn't looking for anything provocative, but reading an online article, the switcheroo hit me. Because there's some things you clearly can't trivialize or pass off as a joke, or not easily. But I imagined a place where people yelled at you you needed to focus to stop making stupid mistakes, and of course it could be far FAR worse, and perhaps they want you to concentrate on that and also on being a productive member of society at the same time, when at the same time they'd never have such low standards themselves.[paragraph break]The gallows humor here I also saw is that the [bad-guy] never sends you here, because you aren't that bad, and he wouldn't be nearly that bad, so stop complaining.[paragraph break]And while my writerly fee-fees are far from the most important thing, here, I was genuinely unnerved that I saw these links and my abstract-reasoning brain part went ahead with them, poking at the words for irony when there was something far more serious underneath. The contradiction here is that many people will tell you 1) it could be way worse and 2) dude, have some standards! And that's the sort of manipulation Alec, or too many people, don't know how to deal with, and there's not much teaching on the subject.[stopping]"

0	--	Hut Ten	"This was brought about by all the countless drills I was forced into in Boy Scouts, as well as the fear of possible war with the Russians and me getting drafted. I was also nervous for a few days about the first Iraq War, and what if it lasted [']til I went to college? Fortunately, the US got in and got out quickly, and there were totally no problems at all after that, amirite.[paragraph break]Also, I never got to implement as many silly 'death' rooms as I thought, but this was an obvious pun to conjure up images of Stalag 17 or something."
0	--	A Beer Pound	"This came up when I was looking for better names for the Sinister Bar (now the Soda Club) post-release. I wanted a place for alcohol-related offenses but had nowhere until this seemed a bit obvious.[paragraph break]I think there's a chance to be moralistic about alcohol no matter how much you drink. Maybe you are sure you need it after a hard day's work, or people never should've started. I've seen my share of people cutting down others who don't know their limits, including former employees upset with a junior employee they took out drinking and he found it hard to control. It's sad and unfortunate, and I've had my fair share of awkward explanations that, well, I'd be a fool to risk drinking."
0	--	In-Dignity Heap	"This was only put in to make the map 8x8 but I think it's a good one. People with seeming dignity giving pompous morality lectures do heap indignity on others. And some of us take it for our own good.[paragraph break]Also, it's hard to be dignified on a heap, and the 'in' prefix provides fodder for a lot of puns. I wasn't able to use this on an item, so there is a fake death location."
0	--	Shape Ship	"What better place to get ship shape than on a shape ship? Again, the creative deaths/failures didn't pile up enough, but I still enjoyed imagining all this. Also, if you've ever read any novels about rough life on a ship, well, this is just a gimme."
0	--	Criminals' Harbor	"This pun was too good to pass up. It could have been lumped with Shape Ship, but I liked them both too much."
0	--	Maintenance High	"Most people who complain about others being high maintenance usually are emotionally high maintenance themselves. So I imagined a place where people learned WHY they were high maintenance and had it beat into their skulls. If they learned quickly, see, it was right. If not, well, they're taking up teaching time. Where people doled out abuse and projected their own deficiencies on others.[paragraph break]One irony I've found about actively avoiding being high maintenance is that I've often forgotten to do simple things to keep things going. Most of the time that's paying a bill or putting off an eye doctor appointment. But more seriously, it's tough for me to evaluate high maintenance versus high standards."
0	--	Fight Fair	"Of course, none of the fights in Fight Fair are remotely fair, and fights at fairs in general are, well, rigged. It also seemed to be a good way to underscore pitting less popular kids against each other, or against a bully-henchman to grind them down."
0	--	Punishment Capitol	"I'm opposed to capital punishment. And I think the [bad-guy] is, too, though he does like to retaliate more vigorously than any (perceived) attack on him. I needed a place for the big crimes, and here it is. It's the place for the worst crimes, like attacking the [bad-guy]. Obviously, it had to be."

0	--	One Route	"It was either this or One Square or Way One, at the beginning. But those two got carded off to something better: Meal Square and, well, Way of Right should be in Slicker City." [begin speculative locations]
0	--	Muster Pass	"It was a close call between here and Judgment Pass, but only one could pass muster. Err, sorry about that. Judgment pass won out because it allowed for an NPC I could satirize a bit more."
0	--	Rage Road	"This flip made me giggle immediately, but it was one of those things where I could do better. The flipped meaning wasn't skewed enough. So when I stumbled on Chipper Wood, I decided to change it. That said, even though road rage is serious, it's fun to make fun of the silly ambitions behind it.[paragraph break]I also had ideas for a diner called [activation of road pizza]." [temproom rage road]
0	--	Chicken Free Range	"The Chicken Free Range is, well, free of everyone. It was replaced by the Speaking Plain and Chipper Wood. As much as I like the idea of rotating two of three names, the problem is that you have six possibilities now, which gets confusing. Plus, free-range chicken may be a bit obscure, though I like the connotation of chicken-free range as the self-contradictory booming edict 'THOU SHALT NOT FEAR.'"
0	--	Humor Gallows	"This was originally part of the main map, but the joke wasn't universal enough. I like the idea of killing jokes from something that should be funny, the reverse of gallows humor--which draws humor from tragedy or near tragedy. As well as the variety of ways jokes can be killed."
0	--	Tuff Butt Fair	"This was one of the first locations I found, and I took it, and I put it in the game. Tough butt/tough but is a good pun, and I have a personal test that if I can picture pundits calling a person 'tough but fair,' that person is a loudmouthed critical jerk. The only problem is, 'fair but tough' isn't really a fair flip. It was replaced by the Interest Compound, which became the Discussion Block, and Judgment Pass.[paragraph break]I originally thought of a lot of real people I could put in here, but I settled for putting them into the [bad-guy]'s name dropping at the end, for humor value and also to show him being socially 'conscious,' I mean, ambitious. However, for a truly atrocious inside joke, I was tempted to put in a bully named Nelson Graham who beat other kids up for playing games over three years old--or for even TRYING to make their own programming language. Especially one without even any graphics! I decided against even hinting at--oops."
0	--	Ill Falls	"This was simply a good pun that might have afforded a play on Ill, which often means beautiful and ugly at the same time. Or it could be a verb: to ill means to be out of it, or to insult someone, well or poorly."
0	--	Eternal Hope Springs	"This was the original place you'd sleep. Then I put the warmer bench, but then I discovered the Joint Strip as perfectly seedy. Since, like Chicken Free Range, this had three substantive words in its name, it didn't quite fit the room aesthetic. But I still liked the name, and it probably catalyzed other ideas before becoming obsolete."
0	--	Brains Beat	"I like the image of brainy people walking a beat, talking about stuff, making someone (figuratively, of course) want to beat their brains in. Them being themselves or the others. Intellectual Conversation in general drives me up the wall when it is too ostentatious."
0	--	Madness March	"Unsurprisingly, I thought of this one in March. But I didn't feel it was universal enough. March Madness is a big deal in the US among basketball fans. In fact, even non-basketball fans enter (nominally illegal) betting pools in this 68-game knockout tournament. I was planning to have a bunch of people getting into stupid arguments with someone winning, but I hadn't the heart to implement it."
0	--	Window Bay	"I liked the reversal on architecture for a more natural and magical setting."

table of annotations (continued) [toa-items]
anno-num	exam-thing	anno-loc	anno-long (text)
0	game shell	Smart Street	"This was originally a location, and its predecessor was the Gallery Peanut, which got shuffled to Meal Square, then to a potential sequel. But once I moved the Peanut, the Shell became obvious: a place where you could play games and win, but never really win anything valuable. Or you'd lose interest, or confidence."
0	round stick	Round Lounge	"It took a bit of time to find the magic item to cross over into the truly odd bits. Originally it was the Proof of Burden, but that was too magical, too early. And that might've forced the mechanic on you. I think A Round Stick is a bit subtler. Plus it let me put two round things together. In a round location!"
0	mouth mush	Tension Surface	"The mouth mush wasn't around until late in release 1. Originally it was the rogue arch talking, but walking into an actual mouth seemed a bit too creepy."
0	flower wall	Vision Tunnel	"It took me forever to figure what should be in the Vision Tunnel. I couldn't leave it empty."
0	Word Weasel	Variety Garden	"I like books with talking animals, but at the same time, it's interesting to subvert certain tropes. And the Word Weasel worked very well. It also plays on the whole 'you should've seen something from its name' versus 'with a name like that it better be honest.' The Word Weasel was also one of several entities neutered in release 3."
0	Terry Sally	Pressure Pier	"I was a bit wary of having two gatekeepers, but I wanted to contrast them so that Guy Sweet forced you to seem square and Terry (formerly the Howdy Boy before release 3 when I tried to give proper names) gave you the possibility of rebelling a bit, even if it was a bit forced."
0	Fritz the On	Down Ground	"Fritz is the character I have the most affection for. He may be the most well-meaning NPC in the whole game, but boy is he muddled. Also, the phrase 'on the fritz' bugged me in high school. I'm not sure why. But I'm able to get a good laugh from it now."
0	Stool Toad	Joint Strip	"I don't go in for in-depth NPC creation, and I think the Stool Toad fit into that. A general useless bureaucrat who thinks better of himself than he deserves to and doesn't realize his platitudes don't mean much all by themselves."
0	Ally Stout	Soda Club	"The social dynamics of bars and bartending eluded me, but I always figured I'd be the guy a bartender gave a fake smile to. They have a sort of celebrity and soft-power all of their own. They still confuse me, and they definitely still confuse Alec."
0	Erin Sack	Soda Club	"Most of the antagonists in the Problems Compound are male. Erin isn't a huge antagonist, but she does look down on Alec, much like the rest of them. Alec shouldn't be too good to listen to her views, and while they may be generally important, well, Alec needs to take care of his own stuff."
0	jerks	Nominal Fen	"The [j-co] aren't there just for a puzzle. That came together a week before release 1, with the result a few bugs slipped in. But I wanted to establish that there's a lot of insecurity under the 'impressive' bragging, which falls out when they are forced to admit they like certain things that may not be in the mainstream, and you may not be able to say, wow, look at me being retro for knowing all this."
0	Grace Goode	Classic Cult	"Faith and Grace were sort of inspired by the 'minimalist' episode of Absolutely Fabulous, where Max and Bettina make minimal comments on why they are happy. But then there's also the more serious side of how they've given up trying to overthink things and just want to be happy, but the [bad-guy] keeps finding complex 'sophisticated' reasons they're not. They're even betrayed by their own family (Herb Goode) in release 3."
0	Cute Percy	Chipper Wood	"Cute Percy, formerly the Assassination Character, may've been inspired by the Cruel Puppet from Beyond Zork. During testing, Brian Rushton pointed out his puzzle was something like the puzzle in Enchanter where you need to lose a move. I liked the idea of Alec being able to win a chase-game that seemed undoable by using diagonal moves, and I'd had the idea of such an area where diagonal moves only took half the time after playing yet another game where going southwest saved a turn over going west or south."
0	Insanity Terminal	Belt Below	"The Insanity Terminal was just a name, but once I had it, I wanted to make a ridiculous puzzle. David Welbourn pointed out that not assuming something at first led to more than one possible solution, so filling in that hole with a PERL script--and checking the other possible solutions--took a while."
0	Sid Lew	Truth Home	"I suppose we've all been on the receiving end of an argument that felt glib but couldn't possibly be right. How Alec gets circuitous revenge on Sid helped me recoup some of that."
0	Officer Petty	Judgment Pass	"This is maybe a slightly dishonest reverse, but then, you get the feeling that Officer Petty hasn't had much formal training. I'm a big Dukes of Hazzard fan, so it's fun to me to see policemen suckered by their own greed, as OP is when you find the right item to give him."
0	Sly Moore	Idiot Village	"More/Moore was an obvious homonym to play on, but I didn't know about a first name. I thought about Les, but that just ran into itself. I was able to google-spam enough sites to get first names that mean something, but then Sly Moore didn't seem like an antagonist to outwit. I needed someone for Alec to help, though, so Sly it was."
0	Thoughts Idol	Idiot Village	"I had the idea for the puzzle before the idol. Why would Alec run in that pattern? Well, he would be followed--and then it hit me. Alec couldn't get too near the idol for too long, but he had to keep it busy. Combine that with how I always liked to draw eight-pointed stars as a kid, and voila. The puzzle. Going from an idol giving you a long sidelong glance to you spinning it around until it explodes."
0	Turk Young	Speaking Plain	"Turk and Dutch's advice is worthless, but I remember being pressured that I didn't have the common sense of some other kids my age. I took it out a bit on Turk and Dutch and made them pompous--though it might not immediately be obvious why they're wrong."
0	Volatile Sal	Temper Keep	"Sal is probably the person I identify most with. He's probably most on the edge to being aligned with the [bad-guy] or Alec. The thing is: he complains a lot, but the solution is right under his nose. So Alec doing that for him gives Alec some confidence he's not the only one who's dragged his feet, and he can do better."
0	Buddy Best	Court of Contempt	"I don't know if I fully explained Buddy in the first release. Testers were upset he kicked you out--but I wanted that to be sort of the point. He didn't have time for you, and he acted like he was doing a favor giving you anything, and he sort of was, except you didn't need to feel grateful for that. Alec also learns to use Buddy's gift to get by someone else, so that's a good example of getting two enemies out of the way at once."
0	Mistake Grave	Walker Street	"I couldn't resist a chance for a cheap joke. The [bad-guy] is, sadly, one of those people who will condemn you for not being exciting enough, and while there's no way for Alec to outright lose, such a grave gives him a little fear.[paragraph break]Of course, there's no assurance anyone DID actually die."
0	Art Fine	Discussion Block	"Critical discussion of art is good. But hopefully Art is so over the top with his hyperbole, and the art is so obviously bad, that you can see why listening to him might turn people away. I have to admit listening to louder people than myself turned me away from reading in high school. Everything was terrible or awesome! You better not make the mistake of reading a stupid book! And so on. There was a lot of posturing, but I never quite picked up on it."
0	Harmonic Phil	Discussion Block	"I've always had trouble getting into music, and it's hard to describe what's so good about it. But people raving about it has never helped me. I admit I'm dreadfully conservative, often listening to the same song a few times in a row. But a long while back I was surprised to read research that overselling isn't the way to go, and it isn't just a matter of the sell-ees being stubborn or prissy. That holds for more than just music."
0	Language Machine	Standard Bog	"Some people expressed concern that the Language Machine was about choice versus parser games, but I think that's a little too solipsistic and art-on-art. The language machine continues to burble on writing to itself after Alec helps it, but the difference is that it looks for more than just complaining. I fixed some text for the next releases to clear that up. But I'm disappointed that something intended to be optimistic and quirky turned out to be interpreted as an attack on a whole community."
0	Pusher Penn	Pot Chamber	"There may be some problem here with getting Alec to perform the risky task Pusher Penn asks. Only it isn't, as long as he avoids the Stool Toad. So there's a certain element of not worrying too much about obeying the rules for their own sake, and also for helping Fritz the On a bit, and how Pusher Penn sees the impoverished Fritz as beneath him. Also, I was sure to provide Alec with no matches so he couldn't consume the product or the reward. And I do like to put in references to smoking every game, especially after reading a po-faced research article condemning movies for excessive 'tobacco incidents,' which included nonsmoking signs that researcher's pals probably pushed for in the first place."
0	Brother Soul	Questions Field	"[intro-bro]Brother Soul had the easiest puzzle-train to implement once I figured something needed to be in the Spleen Vent."
0	Brother Blood	Questions Field	"[intro-bro]Brother Blood had the second-easiest puzzle-train to implement. I always viewed him as being gaslighted more than the other two, where people claimed he might do something violent due to--the sort of inane baiting they were putting on him in the first place."
0	Brother Big	Questions Field	"[intro-bro]Brother Big takes the most steps to get through, which is fortuitous. But I had a lot of false starts and the path felt artificial until near the end. However, I like that 'you are big and strong so you must be stupid' dilemma he has to face and stare down."
0	Baiter Master	Freak Control	"Once I realized the bad guy's name, I realized I had a serious game if only I knew what to do with him. But I also didn't want to identify him too much with any one person in my near past. I also wanted to have a non-swear version of the name, and I didn't want to waste Complex Messiah. Bingo! Add asking for profanities at the start, which is intended to be a sort of power play where it doesn't matter what you respond, someone will have something mean to say, and you have another twist."
0	Worm Ring	Out Mist	"There wasn't even a location past Freak Control at the end of release 1. But people said it might be nice to have something based on the game's main mechanic and pun making, and I wondered if there were words I'd forgotten. A whole worm provided Alec's way home, but how to MAKE one? The good ending may actually have a tougher puzzle than the very good one--well, without the progressive clues."
0	Return Carriage	Airy Station	"Alec needed a way to go home once I decided on good/very good ends. The Snowflake Special was the first, but it didn't afford a puzzle, and I didn't want modern slang if I could avoid it. Of course, the answer came unexpectedly when I was looking for a way to parse my code for obvious mistakes. That happens a lot. I was worried too long that I didn't have enough ideas, but when I decided one a day was pretty good (say, about September 1, a month before IFComp's start,) they started falling. And they kept doing so once IFComp was over. The final barrier here was, how do you enter the carriage? Get rid of a lock? So I got HAMMER LOCK and then realized I could do more with a hammer."

to say intro-bro:
	say "[one of]The three brothers['] names dropped easily once I saw the Biblical phrase 'brothers and keepers.' Once I did, the puzzles really started clicking. I didn't know who would get what, but each one would obviously be missing something. [or][stopping]"

	say "You can really only just think about it, e.g. e(X)amine or e(XP)lain.";

to say long-school:
	say "You think about how you don't follow any orthodoxy, but everyone seems more clever and creative than you are. All sorts of things. Like you should be doing way better than you should, and how you're too self-centered and too worried about everyone else at the same time. It doesn't make sense. But any one philosophy to explain it all doesn't really mesh"

check examining thought of school:
	if accel-ending:
		if brownie is moot:
			say "Boy! School will be a lot more fun now that you can learn whom to please and not be grumpy.";
		else:
			say "Boy! There were some real bums at school, but you think you know how to deal with them, now.";
		the rule succeeds;

section exprs

an expr is a kind of thing.

does the player mean doing something with an expr: it is unlikely.

understand "face [text]" and "[text] face" as a mistake ("You can't do much to change your face. Well, it can't last. You may need to do something big.") when player does not have opener eye.

Smart Street is a room in Beginning. "This isn't a busy street[one of], but there's a shell-like structure featuring all manner of odd games[or] though the Game Shell takes a good deal of space[stopping]. While you can leave in any direction, you'd probably get lost quickly.[paragraph break][one of]An impressive looking house[or]The Fly House[stopping] lies a bit further away."

after looking in Smart Street when Guy Sweet is not in Smart Street:
	move Guy Sweet to Smart Street;
	say "A loud, hearty voice from the shell. 'Howdy! I'm Guy Sweet! You look like a fella with a [activation of mind games]! Why not come over to the Game Shell and have a TALK before you enter the Fly House?'";
	say "[line break]";
	ital-say "you may wish to see the verbs for The Problems Compound by typing VERB at any time.";

the player is in Smart Street.

rule for clarifying the parser's choice of games: do nothing.

games are plural-named scenery in Smart Street. description of games is "[bug]".

instead of doing something with games:
	if current action is playing, say "You should try PLAYing one at a time." instead;
	say "There are a whole bunch: [the list of logic-games]. You can PLAY them one at a time, but not all at once."

check going nowhere in Smart Street:

You did see that, right? Right? But you solved this all nonchalant-like, so maybe you'll have more fun with a ten-quart jug. And a seven! And a five! I guess it's fun for people who find this fun!'"
gallon jugs	1	"Ignoring any reason why anyone would want this, you continually pour water into the seven-'gallon' jug, then into the ten [']til it's full, pouring the 10 out. Eventually you get 5. Guy replaces the five- and seven-gallon jugs with eleven and seventeen."
gallon jugs	2	"[one of]Just, no. Your unsteady hand means it'll spill something so it's all just inaccurate and, really, who the heck uses seventeen-gallon jugs anyway? You explain to Guy about relatively prime numbers and so forth, and he motions for you to get on with it.[or]You don't need any more busy work to show you know the gallon jug puzzle.[stopping]"
Nim	0	"Guy sets the game up, putting pegs randomly in rows. You beat him several times, while recalling how students two years ahead mocked you for not understanding simple BINARY. Then a year later you almost got beaten up for failing to explain the mathematical induction behind it to people who didn't really care but didn't believe you.[paragraph break]'Wow. That's impressive. How'd you do that? No, don't answer, I was just being polite asking. Anyway, congratulations.'"
Nim	1	"You beat Guy Sweet a few times and even set things up so he can't win moving first. 'Ah! But can you get the last word in an argument?' he nods significantly."
Nim	2	"Before you can play again, Guy assures you he knows you're a world class Nim player and such. But really, what good will it do you in a future job, or at parties?"
Peg Solitaire	0	"You remember about symmetry, about not leaving pegs too isolated. Bottom clear, left side clear, right side clear. You remember it's tricky with eleven pegs, but you remember the final clump of five. There. That reverse, and done. Guy Sweet is impressed. 'Not bad! But I bet you can't do it again! And a bit different!'"
Peg Solitaire	1	"You proceed again. Bottom, right, left. The end goes quicker. 'Hey! That's not fair! You have a pattern! There's symmetry! That's cheating! I don't know how, but it is!'"
Peg Solitaire	2	"'Hey! No! Don't move the bottom peg up first! Challenge yourself!' It's confusing, but you figure what to push, where, much slower. Guy gives things a shot, bungles it and says, well, he has more important things to think of."
Peg Solitaire	3	"Guy brushes your hand away. 'I'm not interested any more. I'm sure you practiced hard to get so good, but it's kind of boring for me to watch, y'know? Maybe there's other formations that'll trip you up, but I'm too busy to think of them.'"
river boat	0	"You know this puzzle. You've aced it. Bring all three things over without the goat or cabbage getting eaten. Goat over, back, Wolf over, goat back, cabbage over, back, goat over. 'Everybody gets that one,' muses Guy, as he pulls out some additional tokens. 'Now, a boat that carries two of five things.'"
river boat	1	"Despite the extra two things involved, it's really just a matter of counting. Or numbering the pieces. Two and four over, none back, one and three over, two and four back, five over, two and four over."
river boat	2	"[one of]You yawn as you realize Guy's extension to seven things to cross the river is trivial. Two/four/six over, one/three/five, evens back, seven over, two/four/six over.

Rubik's Cube	0	"You figured how to get one surface all the same color, but it just got tougher from there. You had the big picture but forgot if you should twist left down up right or right down up left. 'Well, at least you're not one of those weird geniuses with useless skills,' Guy Sweet says, emphasizing GENIUSES a bit too much for your comfort.[paragraph break]There's a bit left...but you've impressed him, you think."
Rubik's Cube	1	"[one of]You sort of nod that you know how to do the rest. Guy says 'I guess I'll buy it. Anyway, I'm not interested in seeing the rest.'[or]Guy groans as you reach for the cube. Well, you were worried you'd mess it up, yourself.[stopping]"
towers of hanoi	0	"'Big deal, it's almost harder to mess up than get right!' Guy Sweet adds a ring to the left, then restacks the right on the left."
towers of hanoi	1	"You remember to put the first ring on the right. Guy Sweet still chuckles and says it's too easy."
towers of hanoi	2	"First ring in the center. It's a bit of a slog but you can still visualize it. You have to put the small ring back on the left."
towers of hanoi	3	"You remember the horrible recursion problem from programming class which doesn't seem so bad now. With five rings, you certainly have time to plan it. Hanoi (X-1, left to middle), flip X, Hanoi (x-1, middle to right.) Not that the grunt work's actually any fun."
towers of hanoi	4	"You proceed more out of obligation, maybe hoping Guy Sweet will give you a compliment. 'Boy! If you can do this sort of thing, you might be good at something useful! Well? Are you?' It's a rhetorical question."
towers of hanoi	5	"Good lord, no. You know it's going to take all of 63 moves. And, well, you've already gotten through--1, 3, 7, 15, 31, so, 59. There's some sort of twisted bizarre induction that would keep you going. But no."
match sticks	0	"You re-organize, from memory, a few matchsticks to reverse a fish and a martini glass and a triangle.[paragraph break]'What's the matter? These not fun for you? Okay, okay, got some harder ones.'"
match sticks	1	"You rearrange a few matchsticks to change false equations into real ones. These are puzzles you hadn't seen, but then, there are only so many possibilities. 'Dude! Lame! I saw you pointing at where the matchsticks should go, brute-forcing them. I thought you had, like, intuition and stuff.'"
match sticks	2	"'Sorry, dude. I'm all out of matchstick puzzles. And are matchstick puzzles really what life's all about? You know, if you were more social I bet you could find more matchstick puzzles. Though there's better things to do in social circles than matchstick puzzles. But hey, whatever.'" [p]
FreeCell	0	"You win. It's not that hard. It's better than Klondike. Guy shrugs. 'Not bad. Whether or not you're a FreeCell addict.'"
FreeCell	1	"You win again. 'Dude, I'm worried how quick you are at it. Sure you don't waste a lot of time playing FreeCell? Hey, no disrespect, we all have our addictions. Some more interesting than others.'"
FreeCell	2	"'Great, great. You're probably smart enough to actually program a game. What? You haven't tried? Well, even if you did, that'd be kind of dorky, too.'" [p]
FreeCell	3	"'Dude, I get the point. You're good at FreeCell. Look, you don't even know how to shuffle properly, which would help with, like, more social card games, and I'm kinda getting tired of it.'" [p]
hangman	0	"Guy gives you a few long words, which you recognize as easy. You try for the E-T-O-A-N three times in a row, but he calls you out for being boring. Good thing you don't remember the next five most popular letters in the alphabet."
hangman	1	"It's a bit tougher this time. Guy uses a few words with weird letters. You even trip up and guess a letter twice, and Guy insists that counts as something wrong, and you're never going to win that argument. But you pull everything out in the end. You move on to I and D and R and S to start, actually thinking after each move."
hangman	2	"It gets tenser and tenser as the words get down to six and seven letters. On WAXWING Guy asks you if you know what it means (you don't dare to ask back,) and then HAZING almost gets you. Guy keeps asking if you're actually good at, well, using these words? You finally slip on JINXED, where Guy claims you really should've done better after getting off to such a good start."
hangman	3	"Guy shrugs. 'Look, I finally beat you, and I don't want to have to play [']til I can beat you again. No offense but it got kind of tedious even when you changed from that E-T-O-A-N stuff. Maybe you can go figure the algorithm or something to make some tough words, or maybe you can, y'know, use the words better in conversation.'"
chess board	0	"You remember a cheap trick where you can eliminate the queens from the very center. From there it's pretty easy, since they can't be in the corners. You place one THERE--and the rest logically follow.[paragraph break]'Well, that's not fair. You didn't think. I'm sure you used a cheap trick. Still, I guess you deserve credit. Even if you don't know any other way.'"
chess board	1	"Under Guy's watchful eye, you can't solve the chessboard the same way again. But maybe if the queens were knight moves away--yes, start at the corners ('Dude! You're already wrong!') and put queens at knight's distance. Then switch one corner queen's row with another, then another pair...trial and error...bam![paragraph break]'Good job, I guess. Not sure if that REALLY counts, either. You were kind of guessing and flailing, there.'[paragraph break]You bite your tongue before asking just what DOES really count--but you can never force a straight answer, there."
chess board	2	"You just don't need any more goading--whether or not you find another position, Guy will invalidate how or why you got there."
necklace	0	"You remember the first time you solved it. After all, there were only seven--well, four places to cut the necklace. Three obviously didn't work. Your math teachers were suspicious you solved it a bit too quickly. Of course now everyone knows to cut the third link in, then 1+2+4 gets all numbers up to seven. Guy Sweet replaces the necklace with a much longer necklace. 'Yeah? Well, what if you got 2 cuts? How many numbers could you make?'"
necklace	1	"You get two cuts this time. 7+1=8, leaving a link of 9 chains. Then cut the 7 as before."
necklace	2	"The third puzzle is just more arithmetic. 17+1=18, so the next big link is 19, and so forth. You see the pattern. You tell Guy you could prove it by mathematical induction, but he cringes in fear. Wow! Micro-revenge! Usually YOU get tweaked for knowing stuff like that."
logic puzzles	0	"You don't even need the scratch paper Guy offers you. There are only so many possibilities and a lot of clues. 'Well, yeah, even I could do that,' he mutters. 'Try something more advanced?'"
logic puzzles	1	"It's a bit tougher, now. You hand-draw a grid on a piece of paper Guy gives you. There are more clues to wade through. It's sort of fun, nosing into people's houses (but not really) without having to ask any nosy que...[paragraph break]'Nice job. I knew a guy who can do it in his head--don't worry, you have more hope than him...' Guy takes the scratch paper and crumples it and throws it away. 'Aw, you couldn't have been ATTACHED to it, right?'"
logic puzzles	2	"You work away. It's a bit tedious, and you're not sure what you get, and you remember burning through a whole book so quickly your parents said you'd have to wait for a new one. It's knowledge you never lose, and as you mechanically fill in a few more, Guy crumples it and throws it."
logic puzzles	3	"That's the problem with logic matrix puzzles. You do too many, you prove to yourself they're not interesting, the clue combos can go so many ways. It might be interesting to see how to generate them, but that's too far out there. You see a clear choice between seeming lazy and potentially boring Guy, and after some mental gymnastics, you opt for lazy.[paragraph break]There's a brain game in here for a third option you can't quite solve.

You're still upset about things, but you impress people with it now.

You two have a good laugh about things--you're even able to laugh at yourself, which of course gives you the right to laugh at people who haven't figured things out yet. Humor helps you deal, well, if it doesn't suck. You realize how silly you were before with all your fears, and you try to communicate that to a few creeps who don't want to be social.
