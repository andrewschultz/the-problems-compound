<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>

This walkthrough is based on the TEST commands I used. Inform 7 is incredibly handy for that! Of course, I went through it by hand, because text adventures are made with love and care.<p />

The commands below aren't the only commands that work. However, synonyms should work, too, as should the command to short-cut conversations. This is a no-frills walkthrough and, of course, it may spoil a lot. It also does not tell you how to get past the Character or the Terminal.

<p>A big-picture map of the walkthrough is available in PDF format. It should be included in with the main file bundle.

<p>This has been checked several times. I hope it works out and doesn't spoil too much.

<a name="street"></a><h2>The Street</h2>
First, there's no real puzzle to get past Smart Street. Talk to Guy, play a few games..<br />

Getting past the arch is a bit trickier, but still, there are only so many objects.<p />

<a name="pier">
<h2>The Pier</h2>
You need four demerits/boo ticketies to get past the Howdy Boy. There are seven possible, but let's get the clearest.<p />

<p><b><i>Note: you can get a demerit by dropping the tickety. That means one less demerit to get the hard way. You can also say hello and goodbye to Lily twice, and that will creep her out, getting the Stool Toad after you. You can also go a "can't go that way" in the Joint Strip several times.</i></b>

Now you need to help the three brothers guarding Freak Control so they have something better to do. It doesn't matter who goes first, so let's start with Brother Blood. The numbers indicate when the game gives you a point.

<h2>Brother Big</h2>
Brother Big presents the (ahem) biggest problem. You already solved part of his quest when you got through Brother Blood, because you need to get behind the Pyramid for them both.

<a name="jerks">
<h2>The Jerks</h2>
Now you just need to get to Freak Control. Those Jerks may be where it's at. This is a logic puzzle you can solve by brute force (poke each jerk with each possible accusation until they shy away from you. That's the right one.) or you can read the Labor Child's Finger Index. Everything is scrambled randomly each game. You also have plenty of ways to cheat. LISTEN tracks if you are demoralizing the jerks. (1/17)

<p />Each letter in the Finger Index refers to a specific jerk, and this can be deduced logically.
<ol>
<li>J is Dandy Jim, because that's the only jerk with J.
<li>M is Warm Luke or Dandy Jim, so it's Warm Luke.
<li>D is Warner Dyer or Dandy Jim, so it's Warner Dyer.
<li>K is Warm Luke or Paul Kast, so it's Paul Kast.
<li>T is Paul Kast or Wash White, so it's Wash White.
<li>L is Warm Luke, Paul Kast or Silly Boris, so it's Silly Boris.
<li>The remaining one must be Cain Reyes.
</ol>

Now there are two ways through. One just has you escape. The other rallies Idiot Village behind you.

Okay, so now Alec is by a Worm Ring, but what to do with it? If only it were a Whole Worm. You need to do something to the ring...and any of the three below will work.<p />
>CHANGE RING (1/19)<br />
>HOLLOW RING<br />
>TONE RING<p />

<h2>Best Ending</h2>

Here, Alec needs to deal with the Thoughts Idol. But he can't face it as-is. Now, the paper and terminal can be completed at any time, but let's nail them down now.

>w<br />
>enter paper<p />

If Alec just chases right off, he is just behind. The basic idea of this puzzle is to lose a turn. Fortunately, Alec can go diagonally, and that makes all the difference. Here is one way.
>se<br />
>se<br />
>se<p />
Now Alec is an even number of turns away from the Character. He can pretty much run at the character, who will always run away when Alec gets close. So you don't have to worry about, say, if Alec is NW and goes E-W-E-W and the Character goes W-E-W-E.<p />
>d<br />
The Insanity Terminal is trickier. Eight questions, six answers. It turns out the answer is A BAD FACE.<p />
>d<br />
The notes crib below gives hints for the game, but the crocked half is more important. Half of what? Well, if you drew its mirror image, you get an eight pointed star. Now go back to Idiot Village.<p />

Now there are two ways through. Each is equally good.<p />

In Airy Station, you need to make the hammer something different to leave the Compound. There are three solutions.<p />
>LOCK HAMMER (1/19)<br />
>HOME HAMMER<br />

Hope you enjoyed this, and hopefully the sequel, Slicker City, can live up to it for you, or do better!<br />
