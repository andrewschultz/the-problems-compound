The Problems Compound release 3 notes

by Andrew Schultz

============================================================

This is the third release of The Problems Compound. The first release was for IFComp 2015, on September 28, and the second was on March 31, 2016.

(Write in people who helped here)

This is largely a maintenance release without many flashy new features, though Alec has a new food on Tray B to eat. It addresses some bugs discovered and in release 2, as well as some user-friendliness issues. The source code is now above 650,000 bytes, and...well, I think I'm ready to move on.

The milestones for release 3 can be seen at https://github.com/andrewschultz/the-problems-compound/milestones/v3%20coding%20tweaks, but that's not everything.

I managed to make more automated tests for the jerks, which spurred many of the changes.

The major stuff is here.
--mint now works as planned (BUG in R2)
--Alec now has a new bad food on Tray B which makes him "happy," but not really.
--PE now toggles exits in the header.
--the bartender is renamed to Ally Stout. The Punch Sucker is now a customer mentioned peripherally.
--the Howdy Boy is now Terry Sally, which is kind of between two words.
--two new jump verbs to get by just the jerks or just the brothers.

The user-friendliness stuff is here.
--SKIP replaces GLIB as a verb. TESTJUMP (not seen in the release) is now the testing verb.
--the final question rule is now organized by (my stuff) (their stuff) and BOLD choices haven't been chosen yet, while italic have.
--walkthrough and InvisiClues touched up to address new alternate jerk solutions.
--the jerks' puzzle now lets you type, say, 1234567, and it clues you if one number is wrong and you gave the wrong guy a mint. The jerk-ordering is still arbitrary, but the game tells you that.
--some concepts were revealed on start before, but now, a tracking file sees if they should be revealed.
--push and pull now map to open. This isn't huge, technically, but I'll use it going forward.
--fixed "can't go that way" in Service Community (up/down gave something weird).

There's random stuff, too:
-you can now play Hangman with Guy Sweet
--a few extra silly concepts added. Up to 170, from 66 in release 2. Game text added here and there.
--the bad guy now has individual people he randomly insults outside of those in the game proper. They're a bit topical, but they're in the general knowledge realm. If nothing else, you can Google them. He's up to 24 random important administrative and philosophical matters.
--flexible maximum in score e.g. 0/(18-21) so the player knows if they're close, or they need to do more.
--new songs (15, up from 13).
--new books (54, up from 38).
--XYZZY in Freak Control now gives a horribly silly side story I just couldn't pass up.
--Uncle Dutch and Turk Young now have 12 bits of wisdom, up from 8.
--the jerks now have 6 girls they talk about, if swearing is on. They don't actually swear, but...well, they're teenagers. Talking as teenagers do.
