The Problems Compound release 3 notes

by Andrew Schultz

============================================================

This is the third release of The Problems Compound. The first release was for IFComp 2015, on September 28, and the second was on March 31, 2016.

(Write in people who helped here)

This is largely a maintenance release without many new features. It addresses some bugs discovered and features unimplemented in release 2. The source code is now above 650,000 bytes, and...well, I think I'm ready to move on.

The milestones for release 3 can be seen at https://github.com/andrewschultz/the-problems-compound/milestones/v3%20coding%20tweaks, but that's not everything.

I managed to make more automated tests for the jerks, which spurred many of the changes.

--mint now works as planned (BUG in R2)
--SKIP replaces GLIB as a verb. TESTJUMP is now the testing verb.
--the final question rule is now organized by (my stuff) (their stuff) and BOLD choices haven't been chosen yet, while italic have.
--walkthrough and InvisiClues touched up to address new alternate jerk solutions.
--the jerks' puzzle now lets you type, say, 1234567, and it clues you if one number is wrong and you gave the wrong guy a mint. Unfortunately, the jerk-ordering is still arbitrary.
--some concepts were revealed on start before, but now, a tracking file sees if they should be revealed.
--push and pull now map to open. This isn't huge, technically, but I'll use it going forward.
--a few extra silly concepts added
--the bad guy now has individual people he randomly insults outside of those you meet
--flexible maximum in score e.g. 0/(18-21)
--fixed "can't go that way" in Service Community (up/down gave something weird)
--PE now toggles exits in the header
